<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p>Sir Joshua Reynolds&mdash;to whom is the name unfamiliar?
to whom, hearing it, does not appear in mental
vision the equally familiar autograph portrait of the deaf
artist? This picture, painted originally for Mr. Thrale, shows us
the painter "in his habit as he lived," spectacles on nose, ear-trumpet
in hand&mdash;in short, exactly as he was known to his
intimates in his latter days in domestic life. Another autograph
picture of the artist in younger life hangs to-day in the National
Gallery. Close by is seen the portrait by the same hand of his
equally illustrious friend, bluff, common-sense Dr. Johnson,
whom he represents as reading and holding his book close to
his eyes after the manner of the short-sighted. It would seem
that this mode of representation roused Dr. Johnson's ire. "It
is not friendly," he remarked, "to hand down to posterity the
imperfections of any person." This comment of the doctor's
is equally characteristic of the man and his times. At so low
an ebb was art and art criticism in those days, that people less
learned than Johnson failed to grasp the truth of Reynolds'
dictum, now become almost a commonplace, that a portrait
but receives enhanced value as a human and historical document
if it makes us acquainted with any natural peculiarity that
characterises the person delineated. Johnson rebelled against
the notion he deduced from this circumstance that Sir Joshua
would make him known to posterity by his defects only; he
vowed to Mrs. Thrale he would not be so known. "Let Sir
Joshua do his worst, . . . he may paint himself as deaf as he
chooses, but I will not be blinking Sam."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
    In this anecdote, in this juxtaposition of two great names,
each thoroughly representative of their epoch, can be traced both
the cause of Sir Joshua's success, and of the difficulties against
which he had to strive. Reynolds may with truth be named
the father of modern English art, for before him English art
can scarcely be said to have existed, since what was produced
on British soil was chiefly the work of foreigners. The records
even of this older art are sufficiently barren. It would appear
that in the reign of Henry III. some foreign artists were invited
over to decorate Winchester Castle, but of them and their works
little trace remains. At the time when Italy was producing her
masterpieces no native artist of whom we have record
bedaubed canvas in Great Britain; and when the pomp-loving
Henry VIII. wished to vie with his great contemporaries,
Charles V., Leo X., and Francis I., he had to turn to the Continent
for the men to execute his desires. That he himself had
no true taste or love for the arts is well known; it was purely
the spirit of emulation that prompted him. How crude were
his own art notions may be gathered from the written instructions
he left for a monument to his memory. They serve
equally to illustrate the state of public taste in England at a
period when Italy was inspired by the genius of Michael Angelo,
of Raphael, and of Titian. The memorandum directs that
"the king shall appear on horseback, of the stature of a goodly
man; while over him shall appear the image of God the
Father, holding the king's soul in his left hand, and his right
extended in the act of benediction." This work was to have
been executed in bronze, and was considerably advanced when
Elizabeth put a stop to its progress. It was afterwards sold by
the Puritan parliament for six hundred pounds. Still, for all his
own artistic incapacity, it is more than probable that had not
Henry, for private domestic reasons, adopted the Reformed
faith, England under his reign might have witnessed a prosperous
art period, which, it is true, would not have been native art,
but might have given impetus towards its birth. Thackeray
was fond of saying that it was no idle speculation to suppose
what would have happened had Napoleon won the battle of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
Waterloo. To those who love such fruitless mental sports it
may prove no idle speculation to ponder what would have
happened had Henry's amorous desires not led him to liberate
himself and his nation from the bosom of the Catholic Church.
Enough that the facts are there, and that with the first ardour
of Protestant zeal there also made itself felt a chilling influence,
casting a blight over literature and art, and more especially over
art, till then so almost exclusively the handmaiden of religion,
that a work of art came to be regarded as a symbol and
remembrance of popery, and "painting and sculpture were
conscientiously discouraged as tending to encourage idolatry
and superstition and to minister to passion and luxury." Queen
Mary, Elizabeth, and James I., each in their way gave some
encouragement to foreign artists, such as Moro, Zucchero, and
Mytens, but their patronage was purely personal, and did not
operate upon the taste of the nation. More extended influence
was exercised by Charles I. This monarch had a real love and
understanding for art, and under him Rubens and Vandyke
employed their pencils. He also bought many pictures, and
encouraged his nobles to do the like. At least, among the
upper classes the narrow Puritan art views were greatly counteracted.
But Charles had to lay his head upon the block, and
Puritanism had fuller and more unchecked sway than ever
before, creating influences which to this very day are not wholly
extinct, though happily in their death throes. Their latest survival
is the "British Matron" who writes to the <i>Times</i> denouncing
modern pictures that displease her individual taste, and the
artists, happily rare and few, who preach that the study of
the nude and anatomy is no essential part of a painter's
education.</p>

<p>After the death of Charles a general wreck of works of art
ensued. Whatever survived the bigotry of the Puritans was
sacrificed to supply their pecuniary necessities. A curious
mixture of superstition and covetousness was displayed. The
journals of the House of Commons of 1645 afford some
interesting reading like the following:&mdash;"Ordered: that all pictures
and sketches as are without superstition shall be forthwith
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
sold for the benefit of Ireland and the north. Ordered: that
all such pictures as have the representation of the Virgin
Mary upon them shall be forthwith burnt. Ordered: that all
such pictures as have the representation of the Second Person
of the Trinity upon them shall be forthwith burnt." It seems,
however, that these orders were not quite strictly executed.
The Puritan conscience having been relieved by this edict,
many prohibited pictures were sold at a high price to swell the
coffers of the zealots. After this it is needless to remark that
art did not flourish under the Commonwealth. With the Restoration
we find Lely practising his method of portrait-painting,
succeeded by Sir Godfrey Kneller, neither, however, being
Englishmen. The era of George I. produced as native
painters, Richardson and Sir James Thornhill; under George
II. Hudson flourished; it was reserved to the long reign of
George III. to see the birth of what can be truly termed art,
of what alone can measure itself with the nations of the Continent.
Hogarth was the first upon the list, but Hogarth,
inimitable as he is, was rather a satirist than an artist in the
full acceptation of the term. Of beauty of draughtmanship, of
colour, we find next to nothing in his canvasses. Together
with him flourished Hudson, and a little later Wilson and
Gainsborough, who, like himself, and, indeed, like all English
artists up to that time, had imbibed their teaching through the
medium of Flanders, producing exact and careful work&mdash;indeed,
in Gainsborough's case, work of real beauty&mdash;but lacking on the
side of poetical feeling and elevation. Such a method must
be regarded as the infancy of art, its purely observant but
unthinking side. It was reserved to Reynolds to open out to
English understanding the vista of Italian art, with its glories,
its perfections, and it is owing to his Discourses, even more
than to his works, that this mighty revolution came about; a
revolution so mighty, so important, that for its sake alone, had
he never limned a canvas, the name of Reynolds should stand
forth proudly in the annals of England. It was he who, coming
to Italy, already in mature manhood, as a finished artist in the
eyes of his countrymen, had the perception and the courage to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
admit before the works of Raphael and Michael Angelo that it
was needful for him "to become as a little child" and recommence
his studies upon principles of which hitherto he was
ignorant.</p>

<p>Joshua Reynolds was born at Plympton, in Devonshire,
July 16th, 1723, the tenth child of the Rev. Samuel Reynolds,
rector of Plympton and principal of the local grammar school.
His father was the boy's only instructor. He had destined
him, it would seem, for the medical profession, and Reynolds
is known to have said in latter life that if this design
had been carried out, "he should have felt the same determination
to become the most eminent physician as he then felt
to be the first painter of his age and country." It was, indeed,
his decided opinion (an opinion modern psychology would
hardly endorse) that "the superiority attainable in any pursuit
whatever does not originate in an innate propensity of the
mind for that pursuit in particular, but depends on the general
strength of the intellect, and on the intense and constant
application of that strength to a specific purpose." He held
that ambition was the cause of eminence, but that accident
pointed out the means. It is impossible to decide whether or
no Reynolds illustrates his own theory, but from what he said
in private, and also in his Discourses, many erroneous conclusions
are drawn as to this point. As his biographer,
Northcote, justly observes, Reynolds "never meant to deny the
existence of genius, supposing the term to denote a greater
degree of natural capacity in some minds than others; but he
always contended strenuously against the vulgar and absurd
interpretation of the word, which supposes that the same person
may be a man of genius in one respect, but utterly unfit for,
and almost an idiot in everything else; and that this singular and
unaccountable faculty is a gift born with us, which does not
need the assistance of pains or culture, time or accident, to
improve and perfect it."</p>

<p>Whatever Reynolds' private views on the subject of native
taste asserting itself in the young, he himself undoubtedly
showed a liking for art at an early age, and his taste was
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
fostered by his father, himself an amateur possessing a small
collection of anatomical and other prints. If Joshua's love of
drawing did not interfere with his other studies, his father did
not check it. Thus there is extant to this day a perspective
drawing of a bookcase under which Mr. Reynolds has written,
"Done by Joshua out of pure idleness." It is on the back of a
Latin exercise. He copied such prints as he could find in his
father's library, Jacob Cats's <i>Book of Emblems</i> furnishing
him with the richest store. This his grandmother, who was a
native of Holland, had contributed to the family bookshelves.
When he was only eight years old he read with eagerness
<i>The Jesuit's Perspective</i>, and so thoroughly did he master its
rules that he never afterwards had to study any other works on
the subject. An application of these rules to practice is preserved
in a drawing of the grammar school at Plympton. It
was so well done that the father exclaimed, "Now this exemplifies
what the author of the 'Perspective' asserts, that by
observing the rules laid down in this book a man may do
wonders, for this is wonderful."</p>

<p>Visitors to the Reynolds' Exhibition, which was held in the
Grosvenor Gallery in 1884, may remember this little drawing,
which was among the exhibits.</p>

<p>Portraits of his family and friends next occupied Reynolds'
youthful pencil, while his love of art was influenced by reading
Richardson's <i>Treatise of Painting</i>. This book first awoke in
him his enthusiastic adoration of Raffaelle (of whose works he
had till then seen nothing), a love he cherished until the end of
his days. At seventeen his liking for art showing no diminution,
the father decided he should follow a painter's career, and
took him to London, where he placed him under Hudson, the
most eminent artist England could then boast. By a curious
accident he was entered at Hudson's on St. Luke's day, the
patron saint of art and artists. Hudson set him at work at
copying, a system Sir Joshua afterwards strenuously condemned.
His words on this matter, written in the 2nd Discourse, should
be "read, marked, learned, and inwardly digested" by all art
professors and students&mdash;they are golden words of wisdom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
    Notwithstanding the master's inadequate teaching, the pupil
made such progress that he aroused Hudson's jealousy, who,
after two years' apprenticeship, found a pretext for dismissing
him. Reynolds, with what he had learnt, continued to paint
down in Devonshire, taking the portraits of the local magnates.
How conventional his style was at first is proved by the following
anecdote. It was a favourite attitude with the portrait-painters
of the time to represent their model with one hand in
waistcoat and the hat under the arm, convenient because it dispensed
the artist from the difficult task of painting the hand.
Now it happened that one gentleman, whose portrait Reynolds
painted, desired to have his hat on his head. The picture,
which was quickly finished and posed in a commonplace attitude,
was done without much study. When sent home, it was
discovered, on inspection, that although this gentleman in his
portrait had one hat upon his head, there was another under
his arm.</p>

<p>For three years Reynolds painted in Devonshire, and
certainly improved greatly under his own instructions and
those of William Gandy of Exeter, so that some of the works
of this period are undoubtedly fine. During these first years
of seclusion he taught himself to think as well as to paint; and
that the labour of the mind is the most essential requisite in
forming a great painter is a doctrine he constantly inculcates in
his Discourses, distinguishing it from that of the hand. He
aptly applied the dictum of Grotius&mdash;"Nothing can come of
nothing"&mdash;to demonstrate the necessity of teaching.</p>

<p>The more Reynolds thought, however, the less was he satisfied
with his own performances, and that he did not see himself
progress with greater speed no doubt fretted him the more, inasmuch
as he had early declared it his fixed opinion that if he did
not prove himself the best painter of his time, when arrived at
the age of thirty, he never should. For the completion of his
studies he unceasingly felt that he must visit Italy, and behold with
his own eyes those masterpieces of which he had heard so much.
Chance offered him a passage to the Continent in the flagship
of Viscount Keppel, and thus, at the age of twenty-six, May 11th,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
1749, Reynolds first set sail for the Continent, and for the land
of his desires and aspirations.</p>

<p>On Sir Joshua's death papers were found on which were
written a number of detached thoughts, jotted down as hints for
a Discourse, never written, in which the artist intended to give
a history of his mind, so far as it concerned his art, his progress,
studies, and practice. One of these fragments narrates
his feelings on first seeing the treasures of Italian art, and is
sufficiently remarkable. "It has frequently happened," he
writes, "as I was informed by the keeper of the Vatican, that
many of those whom he had conducted through the various
apartments of that edifice, when about to be dismissed, have
asked for the works of Raffaelle, and would not believe that
they had already passed through the rooms where they are
preserved; so little impression had these performances made
on them. One of the first painters in France told me that this
circumstance happened to himself; though he now looks on
Raffaelle with that veneration which he deserves from all
painters and lovers of art. I remember very well my own disappointment
when I first visited the Vatican; but on confessing
my feelings to a brother student, of whose ingenuousness I had
a high opinion, he acknowledged that the works of Raffaelle
had the same effect on him; or rather, that they did not produce
the effect which he expected. This was a great relief to
my mind; and, on inquiring farther of other students, I found
that those persons only who from natural imbecility appeared
to be incapable of ever relishing these divine performances,
made pretensions to instantaneous raptures on first beholding
them. In justice to myself, however, I must add, that though
disappointed and mortified at not finding myself enraptured
with the works of this great master, I did not for a moment
conceive or suppose that the name of Raffaelle and those
admirable paintings in particular owed their reputation to the
ignorance and prejudice of mankind; on the contrary, my not
relishing them, as I was conscious I ought to have done, was
one of the most humiliating things that ever happened to me.
I found myself in the midst of works <i>executed upon principles</i>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span>
<i>with which I was unacquainted</i>. I felt my ignorance, and stood
abashed.</p>

<p>"All the indigested notions of painting which I had brought
with me from England, where the art was at the lowest ebb&mdash;it
could not indeed be lower&mdash;were to be totally done away
with and eradicated from my mind. It was necessary, as it is
expressed on a very solemn occasion, that I should become <i>as a
little child</i>. Notwithstanding my disappointment, I proceeded
to copy some of those excellent works. I viewed them again
and again; I even affected to feel their merits and to admire
them more than I really did. In a short time a new taste and
new perceptions began to dawn upon me, and I was convinced
that I had originally formed a <i>false opinion of the perfection of
art</i>, and that this great painter was well entitled to the high
rank which he holds in the estimation of the world.</p>

<p>"The truth is, that if these works had been really what I
expected, they would have contained beauties superficial and
alluring, but by no means such as would have entitled them
to the great reputation which they have long and so justly
obtained."</p>

<p>It must, of course, be borne in mind, reading these words, that
Sir Joshua Reynolds had not the advantages put into the way
to-day, not only of art students, but of every person more or less
interested in art, in the way of copies, photographs, autotypes,
from the works and drawings of the great masters. He had to
learn to understand, and he at once put himself into the attitude
of the learner, humbly assured that the fault in appreciation
must be in himself, not in those masterpieces. His good sense
told him that "the duration and stability of their fame is
sufficient to evince that it has not been suspended upon the
slender thread of fashion and caprice, but bound to the human
heart by every tie of sympathetic approbation."</p>

<p>"Having since that period," continues Sir Joshua, "frequently
revolved the subject in my mind, I am now clearly of opinion
that a relish for the higher excellences of the art is an acquired
taste, which no man ever possessed without long cultivation and
great labour and attention. On such occasions as that which I
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span>
have mentioned, we are often ashamed of our apparent dulness,
as if it were expected that our minds, like tinder, should
instantly catch fire from the divine spark of Raffaelle's genius.
I flatter myself that <i>now</i> it would be so, and that I have a just
perception of his great powers; but let it be remembered that
the excellence of his style is not on the surface, but lies deep,
and at the first view is seen but mistily. It is the florid style
which strikes at once, and captivates the eye, for a time, without
ever satisfying the judgment. Nor does painting in this respect
differ from other arts. A just poetical taste, and the acquisition
of a nice discriminative musical ear, are equally the
work of time. Even the eye, however perfect in itself, is often
unable to distinguish between the brilliancy of two diamonds,
though the experienced jeweller will be amazed at its blindness;
not considering that there was a time when he himself could
not have been able to pronounce which of the two was the most
perfect, and that his own power of discrimination was acquired
by slow and imperceptible degrees."</p>

<p>From the first Reynolds avoided making copies, and had
refused lucrative orders. He sketched portions of pictures, such
as he thought would help his own comprehension, but he would
do no slavish imitation. "The man of true genius," writes Sir
Joshua, "instead of spending all his hours, as many artists do
while they are at Rome, in measuring statues and copying
pictures, soon begins to think for himself, and endeavour to do
something like what he sees. I consider general copying," he
adds, "as a delusive kind of industry: the student satisfies himself
with the appearance of doing something; he falls into the
dangerous habit of imitating without selecting, and labouring
without a determinate object; as it requires no effort of mind, he
sleeps over his work, and those powers of invention and disposition
which ought particularly to be called out and put into
action lie torpid, and lose their energy for want of exercise.
How incapable of producing anything of their own those are
who have spent most of their time in making finished copies,
is an observation well known to all those who are conversant
with our art."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span>
    His own precise method of study is not known, but it may be
assumed that he was chiefly occupied in reasoning on what he
observed. Elsewhere he writes&mdash;"A painter should form his
rules from pictures rather than from books or precepts; rules
were first made from pictures, not pictures from rules. Every
picture an artist sees, whether the most excellent or the most
ordinary, he should consider whence that fine effect or that ill
effect proceeds, and then there is no picture ever so indifferent
but he may look at it to his profit." "The artist," he observes,
"who has his mind filled with ideas, and his hand made expert
by practice, works with ease and readiness; whilst he who
would have you believe that he is waiting for the inspirations of
genius, is in reality at a loss how to begin, and is at last
delivered of his monsters with difficulty and pain. The well-grounded
painter, on the contrary, has only maturely to consider
his subject, and all the mechanical parts of his art will follow,
without his exertion."</p>

<p>The mode of study which Sir Joshua adopted himself he
continually recommends to the students: "Instead of copying
the touches of those great masters, copy only their conceptions;
instead of treading in their footsteps, endeavour only to keep
the same road; labour to invent on their general principles
and way of thinking; possess yourself with their spirit; consider
with yourself how a Michael Angelo or a Raffaelle would
have treated this subject, and work yourself into a belief that
your picture is to be seen and criticised by them when completed;
even an attempt of this kind will raise your powers.</p>

<p>"We all must have experienced how lazily, and consequently
how ineffectually, instruction is received when forced upon the
mind by others. Few have been taught to any purpose who
have not been their own teachers. We prefer those instructions
which we have given ourselves from our affection to the instructor;
and they are more effectual from being received into the mind at
the very time when it is most open to receive them."</p>

<p>Having stayed in Rome as long as his resources allowed,
Sir Joshua visited Florence, Venice, and some of the smaller
Italian towns, everywhere adopting the same careful, observant
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span>
method of study. After an absence of nearly three years he
returned to England, feeling himself indeed a mentally richer,
wiser man than he set out.</p>

<p>It was after his return from Italy that Reynolds took up his
permanent abode in London, then, as now, the only true centre
for art or literature. At first he met much opposition; Hudson
especially was fiercely critical over Reynolds' new style, saying
to him, "You don't paint so well now as you did before you
went to Italy." Another eminent portrait-painter of the time,
now long since consigned to oblivion, shook his head sadly on
seeing one of Sir Joshua's finest portrait works, saying, "Oh,
Reynolds, this will never answer: why, you don't paint in the
least in the manner of Kneller." And when the artist tried to
expose his reasons, his rival, not able to answer him, left the
room in a fury, shouting, "Damme! Shakespeare in poetry,
and Kneller in painting; damme!"</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Reynolds soon became a favourite with the
public, and his painting-room a fashionable resort. To this
end his courtly manner and agreeable conversation may greatly
have aided. By the year 1760 he had become the most sought
for portraitist of his day, and was making as much as &pound;6000
a-year, in those days a very large sum for an artist to earn,
especially as the price he charged for his portraits was very low
as compared with modern artistic demands.</p>

<p>It was in 1759 that Reynolds first put down some of his
artistic ideas in writing. He contributed three papers to the
<i>Idler</i>, then edited by Dr. Johnson, with whom he had, on
coming to London, formed that friendship which lasted all their
lives. They are the Numbers 76, 79, and 82, and are reprinted
in this volume.</p>

<p>"These papers," observes Northcote, "may be considered
as a kind of syllabus of all his future discourses; and they
certainly occasioned him some thinking in their composition.
I have heard Sir Joshua say that Johnson required them from
him on a sudden emergency, and on that account he sat up the
whole night to complete them in time; and by it he was so
much disordered that it produced a vertigo in his head."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</a></span>
    The following year, 1760, the one in which Reynolds removed
to his larger residence in Leicester Square, is memorable in the
annals of English art. It witnessed the first public exhibition
of modern paintings and sculptures, and proved so satisfactory
that it was repeated, and finally laid the foundation for what
became the Royal Academy. The catalogue to one of these
first exhibitions was penned by Dr. Johnson, and is written in
his usual pompous style. The worthy doctor had little
appreciation for the fine arts, and in a private letter to Baretti,
speaking of this innovation, he says: "This exhibition has
filled the heads of artists and lovers of art. Surely life, if it be
not long, is tedious; since we are forced to call in the assistance
of so many trifles to rid us of our time&mdash;of that time which
never can return."</p>

<p>In 1768 the Royal Academy was founded by royal charter,
and was opened January 1, 1769. Reynolds had been elected
its President, and in accordance with the custom that prevails
to this day, received, together with this dignity, the compliment
of knighthood. On this occasion he delivered the first of his
Discourses, in which, mingled with general instructions concerning
the purpose and method of art, we find the needful
servile adulation of the reigning sovereign. The second, far
more able and to the point, was delivered at the end of the
same year on the occasion of the distribution of prizes to the
students. It contains his admirable views with regard to
copying. From henceforth, on the same occasion, every two
years, when the gold medals are given, up to December 1790,
Sir Joshua delivered such an address to the students, making
in all fifteen Discourses that are read with pleasure to this day.
At the last the hall was so crowded that a beam supporting the
floor actually gave way with the weight. That outsiders should
have been so eager to come is astonishing on this account, that
Reynolds, like most Englishmen, had no powers of elocution.
His manner in delivering his speeches was shy and awkward,
and he often spoke so low that those at some distance could
not hear him. His deafness in a measure may have accounted
for this, for, like all deaf people, he could not modulate his
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</a></span>
voice; but yet more, his truly British horror lest he should
seem to be posing as an orator.</p>

<p>It was no part of Sir Joshua's prescribed duty as President to
deliver an address on the presentation of medals; but, "if
prizes were to be given," he himself remarked in the last
Discourse, "it appeared not only proper, but indispensably
necessary, that something should be said by the President on the
delivery of those prizes; and the President, for his own credit,
would wish to say something more than mere words of compliment;
which, by being frequently repeated, would soon
become flat and uninteresting, and, by being uttered to many,
would at last become a distinction to none. I thought, therefore,
if I were to preface this compliment with some instructive
observations on the art, when we crowned merit in the artists
whom we rewarded, I might do something to animate and
guide them in their future attempts."</p>

<p>It was, perhaps, the fact that Reynolds intended this Discourse
to be his last, his farewell to the Academy he had served so
long and well, that attracted such a crowd. In it he takes a
review of all his past Discourses, and ends with commending to
the students the works of his idol, Michael Angelo. It was a
source of joy to him that the last word he spoke in that hall was
the name of this adored master. "I felt a self-congratulation
in knowing myself capable of such sensations as he intended to
excite. I reflect, not without vanity, that these Discourses bear
testimony of my admiration of that truly divine man; and I
should desire that the last words which I should pronounce in
this Academy, and from this place, might be the name of
<i>Michael Angelo</i>!"</p>

<p>Before the next occasion for a Discourse occurred Reynolds
was quietly sleeping his eternal sleep in St. Paul's Cathedral,
having died February 23, 1792, after two years' suffering, borne
with cheerful fortitude.</p>

<p>There are those who think that English art has rather
retrograded than progressed since the days of Reynolds. To
those who speak thus it is only needful to tell that Pliny already
spoke of painting as a "dying art." After this we need reason
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[Pg xxi]</a></span>
with such blind admirers of antiquity <i>qu&acirc;</i> antiquity no farther.
That Reynolds was a great artist is universally admitted beyond
dispute; but to speak of him as the greatest, as unapproachable
henceforward, is as absurd as to claim, as did his contemporaries,
that anything so able as his art discourses had never been
penned. These were above all impressed by the undoubted
influence Johnson had upon Reynolds' style, giving it that
pedantic ring, that monotony of cadence, that want of colour,
which is precisely what we moderns least admire. We should
hardly assent to the contemporary lines lauding Dr. Johnson
and saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"To fame's proud cliff behold our Raphael rise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hence Reynolds' pen with Reynolds' pencil vies."<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>But then, in any case, such fulsome flattery is not in
accordance with the spirit of our century. We might, too,
now-a-days think it dubious praise that Johnson, after reading
one of his friend's essays and praising it in general, should pick
out one passage in particular with the remark&mdash;"I think I
might as well have said this myself." More valuable we should
consider the praise of Burke, who, writing to Mr. Malone, says,
"I have read over some part of the discourses with an unusual
sort of pleasure. . . . He is always the same man, the same
philosophical, the same artist-like critic, the same sagacious
observer, with the same minuteness, without the smallest degree
of trifling."</p>

<p>This is true; Sir Joshua's polished mind and calm philosophical
observation makes itself felt in every line of his
writings.</p>

<p>There was a time when envious calumny disputed the
authorship of these Discourses, attributing them now to Burke,
now to Johnson. The imputation is too futile to need refutation.
There are those who deny to any man the merit of having
written his own works, commencing with Homer and Shakespeare.
This is a strange craze of the critical mind. Seeing
the work is the result of a human hand, why not, for example,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[Pg xxii]</a></span>
allow that Shakespeare wrote what he claims as his own, in
lieu of attributing the authorship to Lord Bacon? Again, why
should there not have been a Homer as there was a Dante, in
lieu of an aggregation of men? A very petty and despicable
envy, or the frantic desire of saying something new and strange
to attract attention to ourselves, may be pronounced the motor
force of such theories.</p>

<p>Reynolds' Discourses may be described as the first attempt
in the English language at what may be called a philosophy of
art. To this day there are in English few works of this
character. A science corresponding to the German <i>Aesthetik</i>
does not exist in English, for what modern cant has dubbed
&aelig;stheticism, the child's play of "passionate Brompton" and
languishing South Kensington, must on no account be confounded
with a real serious study that in German universities
fills a special chair. The cause for this lack is no doubt to be
sought in the vastly diverse genius of the two nations. The
German is nothing if not abstract; the Englishman nothing
if not positive; and on this account the English take art,
as well as all else, from the practical side. To mention
but a few German works of this character. Hegel has
written a philosophy of the fine arts scarcely less valuable to
art-students and painters, and perchance even as unknown to
the latter&mdash;for artists are rarely readers&mdash;as the works of the
same class written by Winckelmann and Lessing. Reynolds
addressed an audience not merely of readers and theoreticians,
but of actual workers, practical students; and he strove, therefore,
to combine theory with positive facts, hoping thus to
bridge over the gulf which made, and still unhappily makes,
English art-students learn their profession too much by mere
rule of thumb. That Reynolds' work is neither final nor
all-embracing goes without saying. The mere fact that these
lectures were delivered but rarely, forming no designed
sequence, would have hindered such an end, even had
Reynolds' knowledge been sufficient to accomplish it. Under
the circumstances, it is sufficiently remarkable that they really
form so complete a whole as they undoubtedly do. The one
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[Pg xxiii]</a></span>
leading idea that informs them is the necessity for the student
to study the works of the great masters, above all of the Roman
and Tuscan schools; and on this doctrine, then so new, Reynolds
could not insist enough. In his last Discourse, with great
modesty he sums up so ably what he has achieved, that it is
best to let him speak for himself. After saying how unequal he
had been to the expression of his ideas, he continues:&mdash;</p>

<p>"To this work, however, I could not be said to come totally
unprovided with materials; I had seen much, and I had
thought much upon what I had seen; I had something of a
habit of investigation, and a disposition to reduce all that
I had observed and felt in my own mind to method and
system; but I thought it indispensably necessary well to
consider the opinions which were to be given out from this
place, and under the sanction of a Royal Academy; I therefore
examined not only my own opinions but likewise the
opinions of others.</p>

<p>"In revising my discourses, it is no small satisfaction to be
assured that I have in no part of them lent my assistance to
foster <i>newly-hatched unfledged opinions</i>, or endeavoured to
support paradoxes, however tempting may have been their
novelty, or however ingenious I might, for the minute, fancy
them to be; nor shall I, I hope, anywhere be found to have
imposed on the minds of young students declamation for
argument, a smooth period for a sound precept. I have pursued
a plain and <i>honest method</i>; I have taken up the art simply as I
found it exemplified in the practice of the most approved
painters. That approbation which the world has uniformly
given, I have endeavoured to justify by such proofs as questions
of this kind will admit; by the analogy which painting holds
with the sister arts, and consequently by the common congeniality
which they all bear to our nature. And though in
what has been done no new discovery is pretended, I may still
flatter myself that from the discoveries which others have made
from their own intuitive good sense and native rectitude of
judgment (in allusion to the works of the old masters) I have
succeeded in establishing the rules and principles of our art on
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[Pg xxiv]</a></span>
a more firm and lasting foundation than that on which they
formerly had been placed."</p>

<p>It is worthy of note, as yet another proof of Sir Joshua's
justice of judgment and objectivity, that, speaking of portrait-painting
(<i>Discourse III.</i>), he puts it low in rank among the
various departments of painting. He strove with all his power
to elevate English art methods, to lead artists to practice what
he named the "grand style," and it was on this account that he
ever and always held up to imitation the gods of his idolatry,
Michael Angelo and Raffaelle. What he writes concerning
<i>pittori improvisatori</i> may well be laid to heart to-day when
Impressionism threatens to swamp genuine study and careful
draughtsmanship. Indeed, looked at from all sides, Sir
Joshua's <i>Discourses</i> worthily take rank among the English
classics, and it has been truly said that "with Reynolds' literature
was the playmate of art, and art became the handmaiden
of literature."</p>

<p>That detractors have not been lacking is a matter of course,
but Reynolds, like others, can console himself with Goethe's
lines&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Die schlechsten Fr&uuml;chte sindd es nichtt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Woran die Wespen nagen."<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Some of these objections merit reproduction. Who can read,
for instance, without a smile, the words of Blake, that sweet,
childlike mind, which was at once so penetrative and so
uncritical? The smile will of course be one of gentle sympathy,
such as one ever accords to that wayward genius. He writes
in his notes&mdash;</p>

<p>"Whether Reynolds knew what he was doing is nothing to
me. The mischief is the same whether a man does it ignorantly
or knowingly. I always considered true art and true artists
particularly insulted and degraded by the reputation of these
discourses; as much as they were degraded by the reputation
of Reynolds' paintings, and that such artists as Reynolds are, at
all times, hired by Satan for the depression of art; a pretence
of art to destroy art."</p>

<p>Once Blake finds a passage after his own heart: "A firm
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[Pg xxv]</a></span>
and determined outline is one of the characteristics of the great
style of painting!" Against which is written, "Here is a noble
sentence! a sentence which overthrows all his book."</p>

<p>With no more than justice he remarks on the very weakest
feature in Sir Joshua's system: "Reynolds' opinion was, that
genius may be taught, and all pretence to inspiration is a lie or
deceit, to say the least of it. If it is deceit, the whole Bible is
madness." Of the <i>Third Discourse</i> he energetically avers:
"The following discourse is particularly interesting to blockheads,
as it endeavours to prove that there is no such thing as
inspiration, and that any man of plain understanding may, by
thieving from others, become a Michael Angelo." Again&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"No real style of colouring now appears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save through advertisements in the newspapers;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Look there&mdash;you'll see Sir Joshua's colouring;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Look at his pictures&mdash;all has taken wing."<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Again, when Reynolds tells his hearers that "enthusiastic
admiration seldom promotes knowledge,"&mdash;"And such is the
coldness with which Reynolds speaks! And such is his enmity!
Enthusiastic admiration is the first principle of knowledge and
its last. How he begins to degrade, to deny, and to mock!
The man, who, on examining his own mind, finds nothing of
inspiration, ought not to dare to be an artist. He is a fool and
an amusing knave suited to the purposes of evil demons. The
man who never in his mind and thought travelled to Heaven is
no artist. It is evident that Reynolds wished none but fools to
be in the arts, and in order to compass this, he calls all others
rogues, enthusiasts, or madmen. What has reasoning to do
with the art of painting?"</p>

<p>It is evident that Blake has not always fully followed Reynolds'
meaning. Indeed, Sir Joshua is at times a little obscure,
a circumstance his detractors did not overlook, nicknaming him
Sir Obadiah Twylight, and classifying his style as "sub-fusk."</p>

<p>Concerning this <i>Third Discourse</i>, which deals with the grand
style and the right imitation of nature, an anecdote is preserved.
West was at the time painting his picture of the "Death of
Wolfe." When it was understood that he meant to paint the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[Pg xxvi]</a></span>
characters as they actually appeared on the scene, the Archbishop
of York called on Reynolds and asked his opinion
concerning this. Both visited West and endeavoured to
dissuade him. West, firm in his rejection of the classic dress,
replied, "I want to mark the place, the time, and the people,
and to do this I must abide by truth."</p>

<p>When the picture was finished he called Sir Joshua to see it.
Reynolds seated himself before the canvas and examined it
with interest for half-an-hour, and then, rising, said, "West
has conquered; he has treated the subject as it ought to be
treated." So just was Reynolds' mind that he could admit the
truth even when it opposed his own theories.</p>

<p>Ruskin has also contributed his quota to the Reynolds controversy.
Writing in his favourite antithetic style, he says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Nearly every word that Reynolds wrote was contrary to his
own practice; he seems to have been born to teach all error by
his precept, and all excellence by his example; he enforced
with his lips generalisation and idealism, while with his pencil
he was tracing the patterns of the dresses of the belles of the
day; he exhorted his pupils to attend only to the invariable,
while he himself was occupied in distinguishing every variation
of womanly temper; and he denied the existence of the
beautiful at the same instant that he arrested it as it passed,
and perpetuated it for ever."</p>

<p>Thus to Sir Joshua's lot, as to all who put themselves before
the world, has fallen a portion of praise and blame; but the
best praise that can be accorded a man's work is that it should
survive him, and continue to arouse interest long after his death.
This most certainly is the case with regard to Reynolds' <i>Discourses</i>,
and therefore to them may apply what he has himself
said as to the duration of masterpieces. Not faultless, not all-embracing,
but full of historical and individual interest, of keen
and careful observation, of judicious thought, they merit the
attention of the modern reading public&mdash;a public far more
largely interested in art than ever existed in the day when their
writer lived and painted and lectured.</p>

<h2>TO THE KING.</h2>

<p>The regular progress of cultivated life is from necessaries
to accommodations, from accommodations to ornaments.
By your illustrious predecessors were established Marts for
manufactures, and Colleges for science; but for the arts of
elegance, those arts by which manufactures are embellished,
and science is refined, to found an Academy was reserved
for Your Majesty.</p>

<p>Had such patronage been without effect, there has been
reason to believe that Nature had, by some insurmountable
impediment, obstructed our proficiency; but the annual
improvement of the Exhibitions which Your Majesty has
been pleased to encourage, shows that only encouragement
had been wanting.</p>

<p>To give advice to those who are contending for royal
liberality has been for some years the duty of my station
in the Academy; and these Discourses hope for Your
Majesty's acceptance, as well-intended endeavours to incite
that emulation which your notice has kindled, and direct
those studies which your bounty has rewarded.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>THE ADVANTAGES PROCEEDING FROM THE INSTITUTION OF A ROYAL
ACADEMY.&mdash;HINTS OFFERED TO THE CONSIDERATION OF THE
PROFESSORS AND VISITORS.&mdash;THAT AN IMPLICIT OBEDIENCE
TO THE RULES OF ART BE EXACTED FROM THE YOUNG
STUDENTS.&mdash;THAT A PREMATURE DISPOSITION TO A MASTERLY
DEXTERITY BE REPRESSED.&mdash;THAT DILIGENCE BE CONSTANTLY
RECOMMENDED, AND (THAT IT MAY BE EFFECTUAL) DIRECTED
TO ITS PROPER OBJECT.</p>
</div>


<p>An Academy, in which the Polite Arts may be regularly
cultivated, is at last opened among us by Royal munificence.
This must appear an event in the highest degree interesting,
not only to the Artist, but to the whole nation.</p>

<p>It is, indeed, difficult to give any other reason why an
empire like that of Britain should so long have wanted an
ornament so suitable to its greatness, than that slow progression
of things, which naturally makes elegance and
refinement the last effect of opulence and power.</p>

<p>An Institution like this has often been recommended
upon considerations merely mercantile; but an Academy,
founded upon such principles, can never effect even its own
narrow purposes. If it has an origin no higher, no taste
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
can ever be formed in manufactures; but if the higher Arts
of Design flourish, these inferior ends will be answered of
course.</p>

<p>We are happy in having a Prince who has conceived the
design of such an Institution, according to its true dignity;
and who promotes the Arts, as the head of a great, a
learned, a polite, and a commercial nation; and I can now
congratulate you, Gentlemen, on the accomplishment of
your long and ardent wishes.</p>

<p>The numberless and ineffectual consultations which I
have had with many in this assembly to form plans and
concert schemes for an Academy, afford a sufficient proof
of the impossibility of succeeding but by the influence of
Majesty. But there have, perhaps, been times when even
the influence of Majesty would have been ineffectual; and
it is pleasing to reflect, that we are thus embodied, when
every circumstance seems to concur from which honour
and prosperity can probably arise.</p>

<p>There are, at this time, a greater number of excellent
artists than were ever known before at one period in this
nation; there is a general desire among our Nobility to be
distinguished as lovers and judges of the Arts; there is a
greater superfluity of wealth among the people to reward
the professors; and, above all, we are patronised by a
Monarch, who, knowing the value of science and of
elegance, thinks every art worthy of his notice, that tends
to soften and humanise the mind.</p>

<p>After so much has been done by His Majesty, it will be
wholly our fault if our progress is not in some degree
correspondent to the wisdom and generosity of the Institution:
let us show our gratitude in our diligence, that,
though our merit may not answer his expectations, yet, at
least, our industry may deserve his protection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
    But whatever may be our proportion of success, of this
we may be sure, that the present Institution will at least
contribute to advance our knowledge of the Arts, and bring
us nearer to that ideal excellence, which it is the lot of
genius always to contemplate, and never to attain.</p>

<p>The principal advantage of an Academy is, that, besides
furnishing able men to direct the Student, it will be a
repository for the great examples of the Art. These are
the materials on which Genius is to work, and without
which the strongest intellect may be fruitlessly or deviously
employed. By studying these authentic models, that idea
of excellence which is the result of the accumulated experience
of past ages may be at once acquired; and the tardy
and obstructed progress of our predecessors may teach us a
shorter and easier way. The Student receives, at one
glance, the principles which many Artists have spent their
whole lives in ascertaining; and, satisfied with their effect,
is spared the painful investigation by which they came to be
known and fixed. How many men of great natural abilities
have been lost to this nation for want of these advantages!
They never had an opportunity of seeing those masterly
efforts of genius, which at once kindle the whole soul, and
force it into sudden and irresistible approbation.</p>

<p>Raffaelle, it is true, had not the advantage of studying in
an Academy; but all Rome, and the works of Michel
Angelo in particular, were to him an Academy. On the
sight of the Capella Sistina, he immediately, from a dry,
Gothic, and even insipid manner, which attends to the
minute accidental discriminations of particular and individual
objects, assumed that grand style of painting,
which improves partial representation by the general and
invariable ideas of nature.</p>

<p>Every seminary of learning may be said to be surrounded
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
with an atmosphere of floating knowledge, where every
mind may imbibe somewhat congenial to its own original
conceptions. Knowledge, thus obtained, has always something
more popular and useful than that which is forced
upon the mind by private precepts or solitary meditation.
Besides, it is generally found, that a youth more easily
receives instruction from the companions of his studies,
whose minds are nearly on a level with his own, than from
those who are much his superiors; and it is from his equals
only that he catches the fire of emulation.</p>

<p>One advantage, I will venture to affirm, we shall have in
our Academy, which no other nation can boast. We shall
have nothing to unlearn. To this praise the present race
of Artists have a just claim. As far as they have yet
proceeded, they are right. With us the exertions of genius
will henceforward be directed to their proper objects. It
will not be as it has been in other schools, where he
that travelled fastest only wandered farthest from the right
way.</p>

<p>Impressed, as I am, therefore, with such a favourable
opinion of my associates, in this undertaking, it would ill
become me to dictate to any of them. But as these
Institutions have so often failed in other nations; and as it
is natural to think with regret how much might have been
done, I must take leave to offer a few hints, by which those
errors may be rectified, and those defects supplied. These
the Professors and Visitors may reject or adopt as they
shall think proper.</p>

<p>I would chiefly recommend that an implicit obedience
to the <i>Rules of Art</i>, as established by the practice of the
great <span class="smcap">Masters</span>, should be exacted from the <i>young</i> Students.
That those models, which have passed through the
approbation of ages, should be considered by them as
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
perfect and infallible guides; as subjects for their imitation,
not their criticism.</p>

<p>I am confident that this is the only efficacious method of
making a progress in the Arts; and that he who sets out
with doubting, will find life finished before he becomes
master of the rudiments. For it may be laid down as a
maxim, that he who begins by presuming on his own sense,
has ended his studies as soon as he has commenced them.
Every opportunity, therefore, should be taken to discountenance
that false and vulgar opinion, that rules are
the fetters of genius: they are fetters only to men of no
genius; as that armour, which upon the strong is an
ornament and a defence, upon the weak and misshapen
becomes a load, and cripples the body which it was made to
protect.</p>

<p>How much liberty may be taken to break through those
rules, and, as the poet expresses it,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"To snatch a grace beyond the reach of art,"<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>may be a subsequent consideration, when the pupils
become masters themselves. It is then, when their genius
has received its utmost improvement, that rules may possibly
be dispensed with. But let us not destroy the scaffold
until we have raised the building.</p>

<p>The Directors ought more particularly to watch over the
genius of those Students, who, being more advanced, are
arrived at that critical period of study, on the nice management
of which their future turn of taste depends. At that
age it is natural for them to be more captivated with what is
brilliant than with what is solid, and to prefer splendid
negligence to painful and humiliating exactness.</p>

<p>A facility in composing, a lively, and what is called a
masterly, handling of the chalk or pencil, are, it must be
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
confessed, captivating qualities to young minds, and become,
of course, the objects of their ambition. They endeavour
to imitate these dazzling excellencies, which they will find
no great labour in attaining. After much time spent in
these frivolous pursuits, the difficulty will be to retreat; but
it will be then too late; and there is scarce an instance of
return to scrupulous labour, after the mind has been
debauched and deceived by this fallacious mastery.</p>

<p>By this useless industry they are excluded from all power
of advancing in real excellence. Whilst boys, they are
arrived at their utmost perfection: they have taken the
shadow for the substance; and make the mechanical felicity
the chief excellence of the art, which is only an ornament,
and of the merit of which few but painters themselves are
judges.</p>

<p>This seems to me to be one of the most dangerous
sources of corruption; and I speak of it from experience,
not as an error which may possibly happen, but which has
actually infected all foreign Academies. The directors were
probably pleased with this premature dexterity in their
pupils, and praised their despatch at the expense of their
correctness.</p>

<p>But young men have not only this frivolous ambition of
being thought masters of execution inciting them on one
hand, but also their natural sloth tempting them on the
other. They are terrified at the prospect before them of
the toil required to attain exactness. The impetuosity of
youth is disgusted at the slow approaches of a regular siege,
and desires, from mere impatience of labour, to take the
citadel by storm. They wish to find some shorter path to
excellence, and hope to obtain the reward of eminence by
other means than those which the indispensable rules of art
have prescribed. They must, therefore, be told again and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
again, that labour is the only price of solid fame, and that
whatever their force of genius may be, there is no easy
method of becoming a good Painter.</p>

<p>When we read the lives of the most eminent Painters,
every page informs us that no part of their time was spent
in dissipation. Even an increase of fame served only to
augment their industry. To be convinced with what
persevering assiduity they pursued their studies, we need
only reflect on their method of proceeding in their most
celebrated works. When they conceived a subject, they
first made a variety of sketches; then a finished drawing of
the whole; after that a more correct drawing of every
separate part&mdash;heads, hands, feet, and pieces of drapery;
they then painted the picture, and after all, retouched it
from the life. The pictures, thus wrought with such pains,
now appear like the effect of enchantment, and as if some
mighty genius had struck them off at a blow.</p>

<p>But, whilst diligence is thus recommended to the
Students, the Visitors will take care that their diligence be
effectual; that it be well directed, and employed on the
proper object. A Student is not always advancing because
he is employed; he must apply his strength to that part of
the art where the real difficulties lie; to that part which
distinguishes it as a liberal art; and not by mistaken
industry lose his time in that which is merely ornamental.
The Students, instead of vying with each other which shall
have the readiest hand, should be taught to contend who
shall have the purest and most correct outline; instead
of striving which shall produce the brightest tint, or curiously
trifling, shall give the gloss of stuffs, so as to appear real,
let their ambition be directed to contend which shall
dispose his drapery in the most graceful folds, which shall
give the most grace and dignity to the human figure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
    I must beg leave to submit one thing more to the consideration
of the Visitors, which appears to me a matter of
very great consequence, and the omission of which I think
a principal defect in the method of education pursued in all
the Academies I have ever visited. The error I mean is,
that the Students never draw exactly from the living models
which they have before them. It is not, indeed, their
intention, nor are they directed to do it. Their drawings
resemble the model only in the attitude. They change the
form according to their vague and uncertain ideas of beauty,
and make a drawing rather of what they think the figure
ought to be, than of what it appears. I have thought
this the obstacle that has stopped the progress of many
young men of real genius; and I very much doubt whether
a habit of drawing correctly what we see will not give a
proportionable power of drawing correctly what we imagine.
He who endeavours to copy nicely the figure before him,
not only acquires a habit of exactness and precision, but is
continually advancing in his knowledge of the human
figure; and though he seems to superficial observers to
make a slower progress, he will be found at last capable of
adding (without running into capricious wildness) that grace
and beauty which is necessary to be given to his more
finished works, and which cannot be got by the moderns,
as it was not acquired by the ancients, but by an attentive
and well-compared study of the human form.</p>

<p>What I think ought to enforce this method is, that it has
been the practice (as may be seen by their drawings) of the
great Masters in the Art. I will mention a drawing of
Raffaelle, <i>The Dispute of the Sacrament</i>, the print of which,
by Count Cailus, is in every hand. It appears that he
made his sketch from one model; and the habit he had of
drawing exactly from the form before him appears by his
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
making all the figures with the same cap, such as his model
then happened to wear; so servile a copyist was this great
man, even at a time when he was allowed to be at his
highest pitch of excellence.</p>

<p>I have seen also Academy figures by Annibale Caracci,
though he was often sufficiently licentious in his finished
works, drawn with all the peculiarities of an individual
model.</p>

<p>This scrupulous exactness is so contrary to the practice
of the Academies, that it is not without great deference
that I beg leave to recommend it to the consideration of
the Visitors; and submit to them, whether the neglect of
this method is not one of the reasons why Students so often
disappoint expectation, and, being more than boys at
sixteen, become less than men at thirty.</p>

<p>In short, the method I recommend can only be detrimental
where there are but few living forms to copy; for then
Students, by always drawing from one alone, will by habit
be taught to overlook defects, and mistake deformity for
beauty. But of this there is no danger, since the Council
has determined to supply the Academy with a variety of
subjects; and indeed those laws which they have drawn up,
and which the Secretary will presently read for your confirmation,
have in some measure precluded me from saying
more upon this occasion. Instead, therefore, of offering
my advice, permit me to indulge my wishes, and express
my hope, that this Institution may answer the expectation
of its <span class="smcap">Royal Founder</span>; that the present age may vie in
Arts with that of <span class="smcap">Leo</span> the Tenth; and that <i>the dignity of the
dying Art</i> (to make use of an expression of Pliny) may be
revived under the Reign of GEORGE THE THIRD.</p>

<h2>DISCOURSE II.</h2>

<p class="center"><i>Delivered to the Students of the Royal Academy, on the Distribution
of the Prizes, December 11, 1769.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>THE COURSE AND ORDER OF STUDY.&mdash;THE DIFFERENT STAGES OF
ART.&mdash;MUCH COPYING DISCOUNTENANCED.&mdash;THE ARTIST AT
ALL TIMES AND IN ALL PLACES SHOULD BE EMPLOYED IN
LAYING UP MATERIALS FOR THE EXERCISE OF HIS ART.</p>
</div>

<p>I congratulate you on the honour which you have just
received, I have the highest opinion of your merits, and
could wish to show my sense of them in something which
possibly may be more useful to you than barren praise. I
could wish to lead you into such a course of study as may
render your future progress answerable to your past improvement;
and, whilst I applaud you for what has been
done, remind you how much yet remains to attain
perfection.</p>

<p>I flatter myself that from the long experience I have had,
and the unceasing assiduity with which I have pursued
those studies, in which, like you, I have been engaged, I
shall be acquitted of vanity in offering some hints to your
consideration. They are, indeed, in a great degree, founded
upon my own mistakes in the same pursuit. But the
history of errors, properly managed, often shortens the
road to truth. And although no method of study that I
can offer will of itself conduct to excellence, yet it may
preserve industry from being misapplied.</p>

<p>In speaking to you of the Theory of the Art, I shall only
consider it as it has a relation to the <i>method</i> of your studies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
    Dividing the study of painting into three distinct periods,
I shall address you as having passed through the first of
them, which is confined to the rudiments; including a
facility of drawing any object that presents itself, a tolerable
readiness in the management of colours, and an acquaintance
with the most simple and obvious rules of composition.</p>

<p>This first degree of proficiency is, in painting, what
grammar is in literature, a general preparation for whatever
species of the art the student may afterwards choose for his
more particular application. The power of drawing,
modelling, and using colours is very properly called the
Language of the Art; and in this language, the honours
you have just received prove you to have made no
inconsiderable progress.</p>

<p>When the Artist is once enabled to express himself with
some degree of correctness, he must then endeavour to
collect subjects for expression; to amass a stock of ideas,
to be combined and varied as occasion may require. He
is now in the second period of study, in which his business
is to learn all that has been known and done before his own
time. Having hitherto received instructions from a particular
master, he is now to consider the Art itself as his
master. He must extend his capacity to more sublime and
general instructions. Those perfections which lie scattered
among various masters are now united in one general idea,
which is henceforth to regulate his taste, and enlarge his
imagination. With a variety of models thus before him, he
will avoid that narrowness and poverty of conception which
attends a bigoted admiration of a single master, and will
cease to follow any favourite where he ceases to excel.
This period is, however, still a time of subjection and
discipline. Though the Student will not resign himself
blindly to any single authority, when he may have the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
advantage of consulting many, he must still be afraid of
trusting his own judgment, and of deviating into any track
where he cannot find the footsteps of some former master.</p>

<p>The third and last period emancipates the Student from
subjection to any authority, but what he shall himself
judge to be supported by reason. Confiding now in his
own judgment, he will consider and separate those different
principles to which different modes of beauty owe their
original. In the former period he sought only to know and
combine excellence, wherever it was to be found, into one
idea of perfection: in this he learns, what requires the most
attentive survey, and the most subtle disquisition, to
discriminate perfections that are incompatible with each
other.</p>

<p>He is from this time to regard himself as holding the
same rank with those masters whom he before obeyed as
teachers; and as exercising a sort of sovereignty over those
rules which have hitherto restrained him. Comparing now
no longer the performances of Art with each other, but
examining the Art itself by the standard of nature, he
corrects what is erroneous, supplies what is scanty, and adds
by his own observation what the industry of his predecessors
may have yet left wanting to perfection. Having
well established his judgment, and stored his memory, he
may now without fear try the power of his imagination. The
mind that has been thus disciplined may be indulged in the
warmest enthusiasm, and venture to play on the borders of
the wildest extravagance. The habitual dignity which long
converse with the greatest minds has imparted to him will
display itself in all his attempts; and he will stand among
his instructors, not as an imitator, but a rival.</p>

<p>These are the different stages of the Art. But as I now
address myself particularly to those Students who have
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
been this day rewarded for their happy passage through the
first period, I can with no propriety suppose they want any
help in the initiatory studies. My present design is to
direct your view to distant excellence, and to show you the
readiest path that leads to it. Of this I shall speak with
such latitude, as may leave the province of the professor
uninvaded; and shall not anticipate those precepts, which
it is his business to give, and your duty to understand.</p>

<p>It is indisputably evident that a great part of every man's
life must be employed in collecting materials for the exercise
of genius. Invention, strictly speaking, is little more
than a new combination of those images which have been
previously gathered and deposited in the memory: nothing
can come of nothing: he who has laid up no materials can
produce no combinations.</p>

<p>A Student unacquainted with the attempts of former
adventurers is always apt to overrate his own abilities; to
mistake the most trifling excursions for discoveries of
moment, and every coast new to him for a new-found
country. If by chance he passes beyond his usual limits,
he congratulates his own arrival at those regions which
they who have steered a better course have long left behind
them.</p>

<p>The productions of such minds are seldom distinguished
by an air of originality: they are anticipated in their
happiest efforts; and if they are found to differ in any
thing from their predecessors, it is only in irregular sallies
and trifling conceits. The more extensive, therefore, your
acquaintance is with the works of those who have excelled,
the more extensive will be your powers of invention; and
what may appear still more like a paradox, the more original
will be your conceptions. But the difficulty on this occasion
is to determine what ought to be proposed as models of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
excellence, and who ought to be considered as the properest
guides.</p>

<p>To a young man just arrived in Italy, many of the present
painters of that country are ready enough to obtrude their
precepts, and to offer their own performances as examples
of that perfection which they affect to recommend. The
modern, however, who recommends himself as a standard,
may justly be suspected as ignorant of the true end, and
unacquainted with the proper object, of the art which he
professes. To follow such a guide will not only retard the
Student, but mislead him.</p>

<p>On whom, then, can he rely, or who shall show him the
path that leads to excellence? The answer is obvious:
those great masters who have travelled the same road with
success are the most likely to conduct others. The works
of those who have stood the test of ages have a claim to
that respect and veneration to which no modern can pretend.
The duration and stability of their fame is sufficient
to evince that it has not been suspended upon the slender
thread of fashion and caprice, but bound to the human
heart by every tie of sympathetic approbation.</p>

<p>There is no danger of studying too much the works of
those great men: but how they may be studied to
advantage is an inquiry of great importance.</p>

<p>Some who have never raised their minds to the consideration
of the real dignity of the Art, and who rate the
works of an Artist in proportion as they excel or are
defective in the mechanical parts, look on theory as something
that may enable them to talk but not to paint better;
and, confining themselves entirely to mechanical practice,
very assiduously toil on in the drudgery of copying, and
think they make a rapid progress while they faithfully
exhibit the minutest part of a favourite picture. This
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
appears to me a very tedious, and, I think, a very
erroneous, method of proceeding. Of every large composition,
even of those which are most admired, a great part
may be truly said to be <i>commonplace</i>. This, though it
takes up much time in copying, conduces little to improvement.
I consider general copying as a delusive kind of
industry: the Student satisfies himself with the appearance
of doing something; he falls into the dangerous habit of
imitating without selecting, and of labouring without any
determinate object; as it requires no effort of the mind, he
sleeps over his work: and those powers of invention and
composition which ought particularly to be called out, and
put in action, lie torpid, and lose their energy for want of
exercise.</p>

<p>How incapable those are of producing anything of their
own who have spent much of their time in making finished
copies, is well known to all who are conversant with our
art.</p>

<p>To suppose that the complication of powers and variety
of ideas necessary to that mind which aspires to the first
honours in the Art of Painting can be obtained by the frigid
contemplation of a few single models, is no less absurd
than it would be in him who wishes to be a poet to imagine,
that by translating a tragedy he can acquire to himself
sufficient knowledge of the appearances of nature, the
operations of the passions, and the incidents of life.</p>

<p>The great use in copying, if it be at all useful, should
seem to be in learning to colour; yet even colouring will
never be perfectly attained by servilely copying the model
before you. An eye critically nice can only be formed by
observing well-coloured pictures with attention; and by
close inspection and minute examination you will discover,
at last, the manner of handling, the artifices of contrast,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
glazing, and other expedients by which good colourists have
raised the value of their tints, and by which nature has been
so happily imitated.</p>

<p>I must inform you, however, that old pictures, deservedly
celebrated for their colouring, are often so changed by dirt
and varnish that we ought not to wonder if they do not
appear equal to their reputation in the eyes of unexperienced
painters, or young Students. An artist whose judgment is
matured by long observation considers rather what the
picture once was than what it is at present. He has by
habit acquired a power of seeing the brilliancy of tints
through the cloud by which it is obscured. An exact
imitation, therefore, of those pictures is likely to fill the
Student's mind with false opinions, and to send him
back a colourist of his own formation, with ideas equally
remote from nature and from art, from the genuine practice
of the masters and the real appearances of things.</p>

<p>Following these rules, and using these precautions, when
you have clearly and distinctly learned in what good
colouring consists, you cannot do better than have recourse
to nature herself, who is always at hand, and in comparison
of whose true splendour the best coloured pictures are but
faint and feeble.</p>

<p>However, as the practice of copying is not entirely to be
excluded, since the mechanical practice of painting is
learned in some measure by it, let those choice parts only
be selected which have recommended the work to notice.
If its excellence consists in its general effect, it would be
proper to make slight sketches of the machinery and general
management of the picture. Those sketches should be
kept always by you for the regulation of your style. Instead
of copying the touches of those great masters, copy only
their conceptions. Instead of treading in their footsteps,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
endeavour only to keep the same road. Labour to invent
on their general principles and way of thinking. Possess
yourself with their spirit. Consider with yourself how a
Michel Angelo or a Raffaelle would have treated this subject,
and work yourself into a belief that your picture is to
be seen and criticised by them when completed. Even an
attempt of this kind will rouse your powers.</p>

<p>But as mere enthusiasm will carry you but a little way,
let me recommend a practice that may be equivalent to and
will, perhaps, more efficaciously contribute to your advancement
than even the verbal corrections of those masters
themselves, could they be obtained. What I would propose
is, that you should enter into a kind of competition,
by painting a similar subject, and making a companion to
any picture that you consider as a model. After you
have finished your work, place it near the model, and compare
them carefully together. You will then not only see
but feel your own deficiencies more sensibly than by precepts,
or any other means of instruction. The true
principles of painting will mingle with your thoughts.
Ideas thus fixed by sensible objects will be certain and
definitive; and, sinking deep into the mind, will not only
be more just but more lasting than those presented to you
by precepts only, which will always be fleeting, variable,
and undetermined.</p>

<p>This method of comparing your own efforts with those
of some great master is, indeed, a severe and mortifying
task, to which none will submit but such as have
great views, with fortitude sufficient to forego the gratifications
of present vanity for future honour. When
the Student has succeeded in some measure to his own
satisfaction, and has felicitated himself on his success, to go
voluntary to a tribunal where he knows his vanity must be
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
humbled, and all self-approbation must vanish, requires not
only great resolution but great humility. To him, however,
who has the ambition to be a real master, the solid
satisfaction which proceeds from a consciousness of his
advancement (of which seeing his own faults is the first step)
will very abundantly compensate for the mortification of
present disappointment. There is, besides, this alleviating
circumstance: every discovery he makes, every acquisition
of knowledge he attains, seems to proceed from his own
sagacity: and thus he acquires a confidence in himself
sufficient to keep up the resolution of perseverance.</p>

<p>We all must have experienced how lazily, and, consequently,
how ineffectually, instruction is received when
forced upon the mind by others. Few have been taught
to any purpose who have not been their own teachers. We
prefer those instructions which we have given ourselves,
from our affection to the instructor; and they are more
effectual, from being received into the mind at the very
time when it is most open and eager to receive them.</p>

<p>With respect to the pictures that you are to choose for
your models, I could wish that you would take the world's
opinion rather than your own. In other words, I would
have you choose those of established reputation rather than
follow your own fancy. If you should not admire them at
first, you will, by endeavouring to imitate them, find that
the world has not been mistaken.</p>

<p>It is not an easy task to point out those various excellencies
for your imitation which lie distributed amongst the
various schools. An endeavour to do this may, perhaps,
be the subject of some future discourse. I will, therefore,
at present, only recommend a model for style in Painting,
which is a branch of the art more immediately necessary to
the young Student. Style in painting is the same as in
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
writing, a power over materials, whether words or colours,
by which conceptions or sentiments are conveyed. And in
this Ludovico Caracci (I mean his best works) appears to
me to approach the nearest to perfection. His unaffected
breadth of light and shadow, the simplicity of colouring,
which, holding its proper rank, does not draw aside the
least part of the attention from the subject, and the solemn
effect of that twilight which seems diffused over his pictures,
appear to me to correspond with grave and dignified subjects,
better than the more artificial brilliancy of sunshine
which enlightens the pictures of Titian; though Tintoret
thought that Titian's colouring was the model of perfection,
and would correspond even with the sublime of Michel
Angelo; and that if Angelo had coloured like Titian, or
Titian designed like Angelo, the world would once have
had a perfect painter.</p>

<p>It is our misfortune, however, that those works of Caracci
which I would recommend to the Student are not often
found out of Bologna. The <i>St. Francis in the Midst of his
Friars</i>, <i>The Transfiguration</i>, <i>The Birth of St. John the
Baptist</i>, <i>The Calling of St. Matthew</i>, the <i>St. Jerome</i>, <i>The
Fresco Paintings</i> in the Zampieri palace, are all worthy the
attention of the Student. And I think those who travel
would do well to allot a much greater portion of their time
to that city than it has been hitherto the custom to bestow.</p>

<p>In this art, as in others, there are many teachers who
profess to show the nearest way to excellence; and many
expedients have been invented by which the toil of study
might be saved. But let no man be seduced to idleness by
specious promises. Excellence is never granted to man,
but as the reward of labour. It argues, indeed, no small
strength of mind to persevere in habits of industry, without
the pleasure of perceiving those advances; which, like the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
hands of a clock, whilst they make hourly approaches to
their point, yet proceed so slowly as to escape observation.
A facility of drawing, like that of playing upon a musical
instrument, cannot be acquired but by an infinite number
of acts. I need not, therefore, enforce by many words the
necessity of continual application; nor tell you that the
port-crayon ought to be for ever in your hands. Various
methods will occur to you by which this power may be
acquired. I would particularly recommend, that after your
return from the Academy (where I suppose your attendance
to be constant), you would endeavour to draw the figure by
memory. I will even venture to add, that by perseverance
in this custom you will become able to draw the human
figure tolerably correctly, with as little effort of the mind as
is required to trace with a pen the letters of the alphabet.</p>

<p>That this facility is not unattainable some members in
this Academy give a sufficient proof. And be assured,
that, if this power is not acquired whilst you are young,
there will be no time for it afterwards; at least, the attempt
will be attended with as much difficulty as those experience
who learn to read or write after they have arrived at the age
of maturity.</p>

<p>But while I mention the port-crayon as the Student's
constant companion, he must still remember that the
pencil is the instrument by which he must hope to obtain
eminence. What, therefore, I wish to impress upon you is,
that, whenever an opportunity offers, you paint your studies
instead of drawing them. This will give you such a facility
in using colours, that in time they will arrange themselves
under the pencil, even without the attention of the hand
that conducts it. If one act excluded the other, this advice
could not with any propriety be given. But if Painting
comprises both drawing and colouring, and if, by a short
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
straggle of resolute industry, the same expedition is attainable
in painting as in drawing on paper, I cannot see what
objection can justly be made to the practice, or why that
should be done by parts which may be done all together.</p>

<p>If we turn our eyes to the several Schools of Painting,
and consider their respective excellencies, we shall find that
those who excel most in colouring pursued this method.
The Venetian and Flemish schools, which owe much of
their fame to colouring, have enriched the cabinets of the
collectors of drawings with very few examples. Those of
Titian, Paul Veronese, Tintoret, and the Bassans, are in
general slight and undetermined. Their sketches on paper
are as rude as their pictures are excellent in regard to
harmony of colouring. Correggio and Baroccio have left
few, if any, finished drawings behind them. And in the
Flemish school, Rubens and Vandyck made their designs
for the most part either in colours or in chiaro-oscuro. It
is as common to find studies of the Venetian and Flemish
Painters on canvas as of the schools of Rome and Florence
on paper. Not but that many finished drawings are sold
under the names of those masters. Those, however, are
undoubtedly the productions either of engravers or their
scholars, who copied their works.</p>

<p>These instructions I have ventured to offer from my own
experience; but as they deviate widely from received
opinions, I offer them with diffidence, and when better are
suggested shall retract them without regret.</p>

<p>There is one precept, however, in which I shall only be
opposed by the vain, the ignorant, and the idle. I am not
afraid that I shall repeat it too often. You must have no
dependence on your own genius. If you have great talents,
industry will improve them: if you have but moderate
abilities, industry will supply their deficiency. Nothing is
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
denied to well-directed labour: nothing is to be obtained
without it. Not to enter into metaphysical discussions on
the nature or essence of genius, I will venture to assert, that
assiduity unabated by difficulty, and a disposition eagerly
directed to the object of its pursuit, will produce effects
similar to those which some call the result of <i>natural
powers</i>.</p>

<p>Though a man cannot at all times, and in all places,
paint or draw, yet the mind can prepare itself by laying in
proper materials, at all times, and in all places. Both Livy
and Plutarch, in describing Philop&oelig;men, one of the ablest
generals of antiquity, have given us a striking picture of a
mind always intent on its profession, and by assiduity
obtaining those excellencies which some all their lives
vainly expect from nature. I shall quote the passage in
Livy at length, as it runs parallel with the practice I would
recommend to the Painter, Sculptor, and Architect:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Philop&oelig;men was a man eminent for his sagacity and
experience in choosing ground, and in leading armies; to
which he formed his mind by perpetual meditation, in
times of peace as well as war. When, in any occasional
journey, he came to a strait, difficult passage, if he was
alone, he considered with himself, and if he was in company
he asked his friends, what it would be best to do if in
this place they had found an enemy, either in the front or
in the rear, on the one side or on the other? 'It might
happen,' says he, 'that the enemy to be opposed might
come on drawn up in regular lines, or in a tumultuous body
formed only by the nature of the place.' He then considered
a little what ground he should take; what number of
soldiers he should use, and what arms he should give them;
where he should lodge his carriages, his baggage, and the
defenceless followers of his camp; how many guards, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
of what kind, he should send to defend them: and whether
it would be better to press forward along the pass, or
recover by retreat his former station: he would consider likewise
where his camp could most commodiously be formed;
how much ground he should enclose within his trenches;
where he should have the convenience of water, and where he
might find plenty of wood and forage; and when he should
break up his camp on the following day, through what road
he could most safely pass, and in what form he should
dispose his troops. With such thoughts and disquisitions
he had from his early years so exercised his mind, that on
these occasions nothing could happen which he had not
been already accustomed to consider."</p>

<p>I cannot help imagining that I see a promising young
Painter equally vigilant, whether at home or abroad, in the
streets or in the fields. Every object that presents itself is
to him a lesson. He regards all nature with a view to
his profession, and combines her beauties, or corrects her
defects. He examines the countenance of men under the
influence of passion; and often catches the most pleasing
hints from subjects of turbulence or deformity. Even bad
pictures themselves supply him with useful documents; and,
as Lionardo da Vinci has observed, he improves upon the
fanciful images that are sometimes seen in the fire, or are
accidently sketched upon a discoloured wall.</p>

<p>The Artist who has his mind thus filled with ideas, and
his hand made expert by practice, works with ease and
readiness; whilst he who would have you believe that he is
waiting for the inspirations of Genius, is in reality at a loss
how to begin; and is at last delivered of his monsters with
difficulty and pain.</p>

<p>The well-grounded Painter, on the contrary, has only
maturely to consider his subject, and all the mechanical
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
parts of his art follow without his exertion. Conscious of
the difficulty of obtaining what he possesses, he makes no
pretensions to secrets, except those of closer application.
Without conceiving the smallest jealousy against others, he
is contented that all shall be as great as himself who have
undergone the same fatigue; and as his pre-eminence
depends not upon a trick, he is free from the painful
suspicions of a juggler who lives in perpetual fear lest his
trick should be discovered.</p>

<h2>DISCOURSE III.</h2>

<p class="center"><i>Delivered to the Students of the Royal Academy, on the Distribution of
the Prizes, December 14, 1770.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>THE GREAT LEADING PRINCIPLES OF THE GRAND STYLE.&mdash;OF
BEAUTY.&mdash;THE GENUINE HABITS OF NATURE TO BE DISTINGUISHED
FROM THOSE OF FASHION.</p>
</div>

<p>It is not easy to speak with propriety to so many Students
of different ages and different degrees of advancement.
The mind requires nourishment adapted to its growth; and
what may have promoted our earlier efforts might retard us
in our nearer approaches to perfection.</p>

<p>The first endeavours of a young Painter, as I have
remarked in a former discourse, must be employed in the
attainment of mechanical dexterity, and confined to the
mere imitation of the object before him. Those who have
advanced beyond the rudiments may, perhaps, find advantage
in reflecting on the advice which I have likewise given
them, when I recommended the diligent study of the works
of our great predecessors; but I at the same time endeavoured
to guard them against an implicit submission to the
authority of any one master, however excellent, or, by a
strict imitation of his manner, precluding themselves from
the abundance and variety of Nature. I will now add, that
Nature herself is not to be too closely copied. There are
excellencies in the art of painting beyond what is commonly
called the imitation of Nature, and these excellencies I wish
to point out. The Students who, having passed through
the initiatory exercises, are more advanced in the art, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
who, sure of their hand, have leisure to exert their understanding,
must now be told that a mere copier of Nature
can never produce anything great, can never raise and
enlarge the conceptions, or warm the heart of the spectator.</p>

<p>The wish of the genuine Painter must be more extensive;
instead of endeavouring to amuse mankind with the minute
neatness of his imitations, he must endeavour to improve
them by the grandeur of his ideas; instead of seeking
praise, by deceiving the superficial sense of the spectator,
he must strive for fame, by captivating the imagination.</p>

<p>The principle now laid down, that the perfection of this
art does not consist in mere imitation, is far from being
new or singular. It is, indeed, supported by the general
opinion of the enlightened part of mankind. The poets,
orators, and rhetoricians of antiquity are continually enforcing
this position,&mdash;that all the arts receive their perfection
from an ideal beauty, superior to what is to be found
in individual nature. They are ever referring to the practice
of the painters and sculptors of their times, particularly
Phidias (the favourite artist of antiquity), to illustrate
their assertions. As if they could not sufficiently express
their admiration of his genius by what they knew, they
have recourse to poetical enthusiasm: they call it inspiration&mdash;a
gift from heaven. The artist is supposed to have
ascended the celestial regions, to furnish his mind with this
perfect idea of beauty. "He," says Proclus,
    <a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> "who takes
for his model such forms as Nature produces, and confines
himself to an exact imitation of them, will never attain to
what is perfectly beautiful; for the works of Nature are
full of disproportion, and fall very short of the true standard
of beauty. So that Phidias, when he formed his Jupiter,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
did not copy any object ever presented to his sight, but
contemplated only that image which he had conceived in
his mind from Homer's description." And thus Cicero,
speaking of the same Phidias:&mdash;"Neither did this artist,"
says he, "when he carved the image of Jupiter or Minerva,
set before him any one human figure, as a pattern, which
he was to copy; but having a more perfect idea of beauty
fixed in his mind, this is steadily contemplated, and to the
imitation of this all his skill and labour were directed."</p>

<p>The Moderns are not less convinced than the Ancients
of this superior power existing in the art; nor less sensible
of its effects. Every language has adopted terms expressive
of this excellence. The <i>gusto grande</i> of the Italians, the
<i>beau id&eacute;al</i> of the French, and <i>great style</i>, <i>genius</i>, and <i>taste</i>
among the English, are but different appellations of the
same thing. It is this intellectual dignity, they say, that
ennobles the Painter's art; that lays the line between him
and the mere mechanic; and produces those great effects
in an instant, which eloquence and poetry, by slow and
repeated efforts, are scarcely able to attain.</p>

<p>Such is the warmth with which both the Ancients and
Moderns speak of this divine principle of the art; but, as I
have formerly observed, enthusiastic admiration seldom
promotes knowledge. Though a Student by such praise
may have his attention roused, and a desire excited, of
running in this great career, yet it is possible that what has
been said to excite may only serve to deter him. He
examines his own mind, and perceives there nothing of
that divine inspiration with which he is told so many others
have been favoured. He never travelled to heaven to
gather new ideas; and he finds himself possessed of no
other qualifications than what mere common observation
and a plain understanding can confer. Thus he becomes
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
gloomy amidst the splendour of figurative declamation, and
thinks it hopeless to pursue an object which he supposes
out of the reach of human industry.</p>

<p>But on this, as upon many other occasions, we ought to
distinguish how much is to be given to enthusiasm, and how
much to reason. We ought to allow for, and we ought to
commend, that strength of vivid expression which is
necessary to convey, in its full force, the highest sense of
the most complete effect of art; taking care, at the same
time, not to lose in terms of vague admiration that solidity
and truth of principle upon which alone we can reason, and
may be enabled to practise.</p>

<p>It is not easy to define in what this great style consists;
nor to describe, by words, the proper means of acquiring it,
if the mind of the Student should be at all capable of such
an acquisition. Could we teach taste or genius by rules,
they would be no longer taste and genius. But though
there neither are, nor can be, any precise invariable rules
for the exercise, or the acquisition, of these great qualities,
yet we may truly say, that they always operate in proportion
to our attention in observing the works of Nature, to our
skill in selecting, and to our care in digesting, methodising,
and comparing our observations. There are many beauties
in our art that seem, at first, to lie without the reach of
precept, and yet may easily be reduced to practical principles.
Experience is all in all: but it is not every one who
profits by experience; and most people err, not so much
from want of capacity to find their object, as from not
knowing what object to pursue. This great ideal perfection
and beauty are not to be sought in the heavens, but upon
the earth. They are about us, and upon every side of us.
But the power of discovering what is deformed in Nature,
or, in other words, what is particular and uncommon, can
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
be acquired only by experience; and the whole beauty and
grandeur of the art consists, in my opinion, in being able to
get above all singular forms, local customs, particularities,
and details of every kind.</p>

<p>All the objects which are exhibited to our view by Nature,
upon close examination will be found to have their blemishes
and defects. The most beautiful forms have something
about them like weakness, minuteness, or imperfection.
But it is not every eye that perceives these blemishes. It
must be an eye long used to the contemplation and comparison
of these forms; and which, by a long habit of
observing what any set of objects of the same kind have in
common, has acquired the power of discerning what each
wants in particular. This long, laborious comparison should
be the first study of the Painter who aims at the great style.
By this means he acquires a just idea of beautiful forms; he
corrects Nature by herself, her imperfect state by her more
perfect. His eye being enabled to distinguish the accidental
deficiencies, excrescences, and deformities of things, from
their general figures, he makes out an abstract idea of their
forms more perfect than any one original; and what may
seem a paradox, he learns to design naturally by drawing
his figures unlike to any one object. This idea of the
perfect state of Nature, which the Artist calls the Ideal
beauty, is the great leading principle by which works of
genius are conducted. By this Phidias acquired his fame.
He wrought upon a sober principle what has so much
excited the enthusiasm of the world; and by this method
you, who have courage to tread the same path, may acquire
equal reputation.</p>

<p>This is the idea which has acquired, and which seems to
have a right to, the epithet of <i>divine</i>; as it may be said to
preside, like a supreme judge, over all the productions of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
Nature, appearing to be possessed of the will and intention
of the Creator, as far as they regard the external form of
living beings. When a man once possesses this idea in its
perfection, there is no danger but that he will be sufficiently
warmed by it himself, and be able to warm and ravish every
one else.</p>

<p>Thus it is from a reiterated experience, and a close comparison
of the objects in Nature, that an artist becomes
possessed of the idea of that central form, if I may so
express it, from which every deviation is deformity. But
the investigation of this form, I grant, is painful, and I know
but of one method of shortening the road; this is, by a
careful study of the works of the ancient sculptors; who,
being indefatigable in the school of Nature, have left models
of that perfect form behind them, which an artist would
prefer as supremely beautiful, who had spent his whole life
in that single contemplation. But if industry carried them
thus far, may not you also hope for the same reward from
the same labour? We have the same school opened to us
that was opened to them; for Nature denies her instructions
to none who desire to become her pupils.</p>

<p>This laborious investigation, I am aware, must appear
superfluous to those who think everything is to be done by
felicity and the powers of native genius. Even the great
Bacon treats with ridicule the idea of confining proportion
to rules, or of producing beauty by selection. "A man
cannot tell," says he, "whether Apelles or Albert Durer
were the more trifler: whereof the one would make a personage
by geometrical proportions; the other, by taking
the best parts out of divers faces, to make one excellent. . .
The painter," he adds, "must do it by a kind of felicity . . .
and not by rule."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
    It is not safe to question any opinion of so great a writer,
and so profound a thinker, as undoubtedly Bacon was.
But he studies brevity to excess; and therefore his meaning
is sometimes doubtful. If he means that beauty has
nothing to do with rule, he is mistaken. There is a rule,
obtained out of general Nature, to contradict which is to fall
into deformity. Whenever anything is done beyond this
rule, it is in virtue of some other rule which is followed
along with it, but which does not contradict it. Everything
which is wrought with certainty, it is wrought upon
some principle. If is not, it cannot be repeated. If by
felicity is meant anything of chance or hazard, or something
born with a man, and not earned, I cannot agree with
this great philosopher. Every object which pleases must
give us pleasure upon some certain principles: but as the
objects of pleasure are almost infinite, so their principles
vary without end, and every man finds them out, not by
felicity or successful hazard, but by care and sagacity.</p>

<p>To the principle I have laid down, that the idea of
beauty in each species of beings is an invariable one, it may
be objected, that in every particular species there are
various central forms, which are separate and distinct from
each other, and yet are undeniably beautiful; that in the
human figure, for instance, the beauty of Hercules is one,
of the Gladiator another, of the Apollo another; which
makes so many different ideas of beauty.</p>

<p>It is true, indeed, that these figures are each perfect in
their kind, though of different characters and proportions;
but still none of them is the representation of an individual,
but of a class. And as there is one general form, which,
as I have said, belongs to the human kind at large, so in
each of these classes there is one common idea and central
form, which is the abstract of the various individual forms
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
belonging to that class. Thus, though the forms of childhood
and age differ exceedingly, there is a common form in
childhood, and a common form in age, which is the more
perfect, as it is more remote from all peculiarities. But I
must add further, that though the most perfect forms of
each of the general divisions of the human figure are ideal
and superior to any individual form of that class; yet the
highest perfection of the human figure is not to be found in
any one of them. It is not in the Hercules, nor in the
Gladiator, nor in the Apollo; but in that form which is
taken from all, and which partakes equally of the activity of
the Gladiator, of the delicacy of the Apollo, and of the
muscular strength of the Hercules. For perfect beauty in
any species must combine all the characters which are beautiful
in that species. It cannot consist in any one to
the exclusion of the rest: no one, therefore, must be
predominant, that no one may be deficient.</p>

<p>The knowledge of these different characters, and the
power of separating and distinguishing them, is undoubtedly
necessary to the Painter, who is to vary his compositions
with figures of various forms and proportions, though he
is never to lose sight of the general idea of perfection in each
kind.</p>

<p>There is, likewise, a kind of symmetry, or proportion,
which may properly be said to belong to deformity. A
figure lean or corpulent, tall or short, though deviating from
beauty, may still have a certain union of the various parts,
which may contribute to make them on the whole not
unpleasing.</p>

<p>When the Artist has by diligent attention acquired a
clear and distinct idea of beauty and symmetry; when he
has reduced the variety of nature to the abstract idea; his
next task will be to become acquainted with the genuine
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
habits of nature, as distinguished from those of fashion.
For in the same manner, and on the same principles, as he
has acquired the knowledge of the real forms of nature,
distinct from accidental deformity, he must endeavour to
separate simple chaste nature from those adventitious, those
affected and forced airs or actions, with which she is loaded
by modern education.</p>

<p>Perhaps I cannot better explain what I mean than by
reminding you of what was taught us by the Professor of
Anatomy, in respect to the natural position and movement
of the feet. He observed that the fashion of turning them
outwards was contrary to the intent of nature, as might be
seen from the structure of the bones, and from the weakness
that proceeded from that manner of standing. To this we
may add the erect position of the head, the projection of
the chest, the walking with straight knees, and many such
actions, which we know to be merely the result of fashion,
and what nature never warranted, as we are sure that we
have been taught them when children.</p>

<p>I have mentioned but a few of those instances, in which
vanity or caprice have contrived to distort and disfigure the
human form; your own recollection will add to these a
thousand more of ill-understood methods, which have been
practised to disguise nature among our dancing-masters,
hairdressers, and tailors, in their various schools of
deformity.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>However the mechanic and ornamental arts may sacrifice
to Fashion, she must be entirely excluded from the Art of
Painting; the painter must never mistake this capricious
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
challenging for the genuine offspring of nature; he must
divest himself of all prejudices in favour of his age or
country; he must disregard all local and temporary ornaments,
and look only on those general habits which are
everywhere and always the same; he addresses his works to
the people of every country and every age, he calls upon
posterity to be his spectators, and says, with Zeuxis, <i>In
&aelig;ternitatem pingo</i>.</p>

<p>The neglect of separating modern fashions from the
habits of nature leads to that ridiculous style which has
been practised by some painters, who have given to Grecian
heroes the airs and graces practised in the court of Louis
XIV.; an absurdity almost as great as it would have been
to have dressed them after the fashion of that court.</p>

<p>To avoid this error, however, and to retain the true
simplicity of nature, is a task more difficult than at first
sight it may appear. The prejudices in favour of the
fashions and customs that we have been used to, and which
are justly called a second nature, make it too often difficult
to distinguish that which is natural from that which is the
result of education; they frequently even give a predilection
in favour of the artificial mode; and almost every one is
apt to be guided by those local prejudices, who has not
chastised his mind, and regulated the instability of his
affections by the eternal invariable idea of nature.</p>

<p>Here, then, as before, we must have recourse to the
ancients as instructors. It is from a careful study of their
works that you will be enabled to attain to the real
simplicity of nature; they will suggest many observations
which would probably escape you, if your study were confined
to nature alone. And, indeed, I cannot help suspecting,
that, in this instance, the ancients had an easier task
than the moderns. They had, probably, little or nothing
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
to unlearn, as their manners were nearly approaching to
this desirable simplicity; while the modern artist, before he
can see the truth of things, is obliged to remove a veil, with
which the fashion of the times has thought proper to cover
her.</p>

<p>Having gone thus far in our investigation of the great
style in painting; if we now should suppose that the artist
has found the true idea of beauty, which enables him to
give his works a correct and perfect design; if we should
suppose, also, that he has acquired a knowledge of the
unadulterated habits of nature, which gives him simplicity;
the rest of his task is, perhaps, less than is generally
imagined. Beauty and simplicity have so great a share in
the composition of a great style, that he who has acquired
them has little else to learn. It must not, indeed, be
forgotten that there is a nobleness of conception which goes
beyond anything in the mere exhibition even of perfect
form; there is an art of animating and dignifying the
figures with intellectual grandeur, of impressing the appearance
of philosophic wisdom, or heroic virtue. This can
only be acquired by him that enlarges the sphere of his
understanding by a variety of knowledge, and warms his
imagination with the best productions of ancient and
modern poetry.</p>

<p>A hand thus exercised, and a mind thus instructed, will
bring the art to a higher degree of excellence than, perhaps,
it has hitherto attained in this country. Such a student will
disdain the humbler walks of painting, which, however
profitable, can never assure him a permanent reputation.
He will leave the meaner artist servilely to suppose that
those are the best pictures which are most likely to deceive
the spectator. He will permit the lower painter,
like the florist or collector of shells, to exhibit the minute
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
discriminations, which distinguish one object of the same
species from another; while he, like the philosopher, will
consider nature in the abstract, and represent in every one
of his figures the character of its species.</p>

<p>If deceiving the eye were the only business of the art,
there is no doubt, indeed, but the minute painter would be
more apt to succeed; but it is not the eye, it is the mind
which the painter of genius desires to address; nor will he
waste a moment upon those smaller objects which only
serve to catch the sense, to divide the attention, and to
counteract his great design of speaking to the heart.</p>

<p>This is the ambition which I wish to excite in your
minds; and the object I have had in my view, throughout
this discourse, is that one great idea which gives to painting
its true dignity, which entitles it to the name of a
liberal art, and ranks it as a sister of poetry.</p>

<p>It may possibly have happened to many young students,
whose application was sufficient to overcome all difficulties,
and whose minds were capable of embracing the most
extensive views, that they have, by a wrong direction
originally given, spent their lives in the meaner walks of
painting, without ever knowing there was a nobler to pursue.
Albert Durer, as Vasari has justly remarked, would probably
have been one of the first painters of his age (and
he lived in an era of great artists) had he been initiated
into those great principles of the art, which were so well
understood and practised by his contemporaries in Italy.
But, unluckily, having never seen nor heard of any other
manner, he, without doubt, considered his own as perfect.</p>

<p>As for the various departments of painting which do not
presume to make such high pretensions, they are many.
None of them are without their merit, though none enter
into competition with this universal presiding idea of the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
art. The painters who have applied themselves more particularly
to low and vulgar characters, and who express
with precision the various shades of passion as they are
exhibited by vulgar minds (such as we see in the works of
Hogarth), deserve great praise; but as their genius has
been employed on low and confined subjects, the praise
which we give must be as limited as its object. The
merrymaking or quarrelling of the Boors of Teniers; the
same sort of productions of Brouwer or Ostade, are excellent
in their kind; and the excellence and its praise will
be in proportion, as, in those limited subjects and peculiar
forms, they introduce more or less of the expression of those
passions as they appear in general and more enlarged
nature. This principle may be applied to the Battle-pieces
of Bourgognone, the French Gallantries of Watteau, and
even beyond the exhibition of animal life, to the Landscapes
of Claude Lorraine, and the Sea-Views of Vandervelde. All
these painters have, in general, the same right, in different
degrees, to the name of a painter, which a satirist, an
epigrammatist, a sonneteer, a writer of pastorals or
descriptive poetry, has to that of a poet.</p>

<p>In the same rank, and perhaps of not so great merit, is
the cold painter of portraits. But his correct and just
imitation of his object has its merit. Even the painter of
still life, whose highest ambition is to give a minute representation
of every part of those low objects which he sets
before him, deserves praise in proportion to his attainment;
because no part of this excellent art, so much the ornament
of polished life, is destitute of value and use. These, however,
are by no means the views to which the mind of the
student ought to be <i>primarily</i> directed. Having begun by
aiming at better things, if from particular inclination, or
from the taste of the time and place he lives in, or from
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
necessity, or from failure in the highest attempts, he is
obliged to descend lower, he will bring into the lower
sphere of art a grandeur of composition and character that
will raise and ennoble his works far above their natural rank.</p>

<p>A man is not weak, though he may not be able to wield
the club of Hercules; nor does a man always practice
that which he esteems the best, but does that which he
can best do. In moderate attempts there are many walks
open to the artist. But as the idea of beauty is of necessity
but one, so there can be but one great mode of
painting; the leading principle of which I have endeavoured
to explain.</p>

<p>I should be sorry if what is here recommended should be
at all understood to countenance a careless or undetermined
manner of painting. For, though the painter is to overlook
the accidental discriminations of nature, he is to exhibit
distinctly, and with precision, the general forms of things.
A firm and determined outline is one of the characteristics
of the great style in painting; and, let me add, that he who
possesses the knowledge of the exact form which every part
of nature ought to have, will be fond of expressing that
knowledge with correctness and precision in all his works.</p>

<p>To conclude: I have endeavoured to reduce the idea of
beauty to general principles; and I had the pleasure to
observe that the Professor of Painting proceeded in the
same method, when he showed you that the artifice of contrast
was founded but on one principle. I am convinced
that this is the only means of advancing science; of clearing
the mind from a confused heap of contradictory observations,
that do but perplex and puzzle the student, when
he compares them, or misguide him if he gives himself up
to their authority; bringing them under one general head
can alone give rest and satisfaction to an inquisitive mind.</p>

<h2>DISCOURSE IV.</h2>

<p class="center"><i>Delivered to the Students of the Royal Academy, on the Distribution
of the Prizes, December 10, 1771.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>GENERAL IDEAS, THE PRESIDING PRINCIPLE WHICH REGULATES
EVERY PART OF ART; INVENTION, EXPRESSION, COLOURING, AND
DRAPERY.&mdash;TWO DISTINCT STYLES IN HISTORY-PAINTING; THE
GRAND AND THE ORNAMENTAL.&mdash;THE SCHOOLS IN WHICH EACH
IS TO BE FOUND.&mdash;THE COMPOSITE STYLE.&mdash;THE STYLE FORMED
ON LOCAL CUSTOMS AND HABITS, OR A PARTIAL VIEW OF NATURE.</p>
</div>

<p>The value and rank of every art is in proportion to the
mental labour employed in it, or the mental pleasure
produced by it. As this principle is observed or
neglected, our profession becomes either a liberal art or a
mechanical trade. In the hands of one man, it makes the
highest pretensions, as it is addressed to the noblest
faculties: in those of another, it is reduced to a mere
matter of ornament; and the painter has but the humble
province of furnishing our apartments with elegance.</p>

<p>This exertion of mind, which is the only circumstance
that truly ennobles our Art, makes the great distinction
between the Roman and Venetian schools. I have formerly
observed that perfect form is produced by leaving out
particularities, and retaining only general ideas: I shall
now endeavour to show that this principle, which I have
proved to be metaphysically just, extends itself to every
part of the Art; that it gives what is called the <i>grand style</i>
to Invention, to Composition, to Expression, and even to
Colouring and Drapery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
    Invention, in Painting, does not imply the invention
of the subject, for that is commonly supplied by the
Poet or Historian. With respect to the choice, no subject
can be proper that is not generally interesting. It ought
to be either some eminent instance of heroic action or
heroic suffering. There must be something, either in
the action or in the object, in which men are universally
concerned, and which powerfully strikes upon the public
sympathy.</p>

<p>Strictly speaking, indeed, no subject can be of universal,
hardly can it be of general, concern; but there are events
and characters so popularly known in those countries where
our Art is in request, that they may be considered as sufficiently
general for all our purposes. Such are the great
events of Greek and Roman fable and history, which early
education, and the usual course of reading, have made
familiar and interesting to all Europe, without being
degraded by the vulgarism of ordinary life in any country.
Such, too, are the capital subjects of Scripture history,
which, beside their general notoriety, become venerable by
their connection with our religion.</p>

<p>As it is required that the subject selected should be a
general one, it is no less necessary that it should be kept
unembarrassed with whatever may any way serve to divide
the attention of the spectator. Whenever a story is related,
every man forms a picture in his mind of the action and
expression of the persons employed. The power of representing
this mental picture on canvas is what we call
invention in a Painter. And as, in the conception of this
ideal picture, the mind does not enter into the minute
peculiarities of the dress, furniture, or scene of action; so,
when the Painter comes to represent it, he contrives those
little necessary concomitant circumstances in such a manner
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
that they shall strike the spectator no more than they did
himself in his first conception of the story.</p>

<p>I am very ready to allow that some circumstances of
minuteness and particularity frequently tend to give an air
of truth to a piece, and to interest the spectator in an extraordinary
manner. Such circumstances, therefore, cannot
wholly be rejected: but if there be anything in the Art
which require peculiar nicety of discernment, it is the disposition
of these minute circumstantial parts; which, according
to the judgment employed in the choice, become so
useful to truth, or so injurious to grandeur.</p>

<p>However, the usual and most dangerous error is on the
side of minuteness; and, therefore, I think caution most
necessary where most have failed. The general idea
constitutes real excellence. All smaller things, however
perfect in their way, are to be sacrificed without mercy to
the greater. The Painter will not inquire what things may
be admitted without much censure; he will not think it
enough to show that they may be there; he will show that
they must be there; that their absence would render his
picture maimed and defective.</p>

<p>Thus, though to the principal group a second or third be
added, and a second and third mass of light, care must be
taken that these subordinate actions and lights, neither each
in particular, nor all together, come into any degree of
competition with the principal: they should merely make a
part of that whole which would be imperfect without them.
To every kind of painting this rule may be applied. Even
in portraits, the grace, and, we may add, the likeness
consists more in taking the general air than in observing
the exact similitude of every feature.</p>

<p>Thus figures must have a ground whereon to stand; they
must be clothed; there must be a background; there must
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
be light and shadow; but none of these ought to appear to
have taken up any part of the artist's attention. They
should be so managed as not even to catch that of the
spectator. We know well enough, when we analyse a
piece, the difficulty and the subtlety with which an artist
adjusts the background drapery and masses of light; we
know that a considerable part of the grace and effect of his
picture depends upon them; but this art is so much
concealed, even to a judicious eye, that no remains of any
of these subordinate parts occur to the memory when the
picture is not present.</p>

<p>The great end of the art is to strike the imagination.
The Painter, therefore, is to make no ostentation of the
means by which this is done; the spectator is only to feel
the result in his bosom. An inferior artist is unwilling
that any part of his industry should be lost upon the spectator.
He takes as much pains to discover, as the greater
artist does to conceal, the marks of his subordinate assiduity.
In works of the lower kind everything appears studied
and encumbered; it is all boastful art and open affectation.
The ignorant often part from such pictures with wonder in
their mouths and indifference in their hearts.</p>

<p>But it is not enough in Invention that the Artist should
restrain and keep under all the inferior parts of his subject;
he must sometimes deviate from vulgar and strict historical
truth, in pursuing the grandeur of his design.</p>

<p>How much the great style exacts from its professors to
conceive and represent their subjects in a poetical manner,
not confined to mere matter of fact, may be seen in the
Cartoons of Raffaelle. In all the pictures in which the
painter has represented the apostles, he has drawn them
with great nobleness; he has given them as much dignity
as the human figure is capable of receiving; yet we are
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
expressly told in Scripture they had no such respectable
appearance; and of St. Paul, in particular, we are told, by
himself, that his <i>bodily</i> presence was <i>mean</i>. Alexander is
said to have been of a low stature: a Painter ought not so
to represent him. Agesilaus was low, lame, and of a mean
appearance: none of these defects ought to appear in a
piece of which he is the hero. In conformity to custom, I
call this part of the art History Painting; it ought to be
called Poetical, as in reality it is.</p>

<p>All this is not falsifying any fact; it is taking an allowed
poetical license. A painter of portraits retains the individual
likeness; a painter of history shows the man by
showing his action. A Painter must compensate the natural
deficiencies of his art. He has but one sentence to utter,
but one moment to exhibit. He cannot, like the poet or
historian, expatiate, and impress the mind with great
veneration for the character of the hero or saint he represents,
though he lets us know, at the same time, that the
saint was deformed or the hero lame. The Painter has no
other means of giving an idea of the dignity of the mind, but
by that external appearance which grandeur of thought does
generally, though not always, impress on the countenance;
and by that correspondence of figure to sentiment and
situation, which all men wish, but cannot command. The
Painter who may in this one particular attain with ease
what others desire in vain, ought to give all that he possibly
can, since there are so many circumstances of true greatness
that he cannot give at all. He cannot make his hero talk
like a great man; he must make him look like one. For
which reason he ought to be well studied in the analysis of
those circumstances which constitute dignity of appearance
in real life.</p>

<p>As in Invention, so likewise in Expression, care must be
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
taken not to run into particularities. Those expressions
alone should be given to the figures which their respective
situations generally produce. Nor is this enough; each
person should also have that expression which men of his
rank generally exhibit. The joy, or the grief, of a character
of dignity is not to be expressed in the same manner as a
similar passion in a vulgar face. Upon this principle,
Bernini, perhaps, may be subject to censure. This sculptor,
in many respects admirable, has given a very mean expression
to his statue of David, who is represented as just going
to throw the stone from the sling; and, in order to give it
the expression of energy, he has made him biting his under
lip. This expression is far from being general, and still
farther from being dignified. He might have seen it in an
instance or two; and he mistook accident for generality.</p>

<p>With respect to Colouring, though it may appear at first
a part of painting merely mechanical, yet it still has its
rules, and those grounded upon that presiding principle
which regulates both the great and the little in the study of
a painter. By this, the first effect of the picture is produced;
and as this is performed, the spectator, as he walks
the gallery, will stop, or pass along. To give a general air
of grandeur at first view, all trifling, or artful play of little
lights, or an attention to a variety of tints, is to be avoided;
a quietness and simplicity must reign over the whole work;
to which a breadth of uniform and simple colour will very
much contribute. Grandeur of effect is produced by two
different ways, which seem entirely opposed to each other.
One is, by reducing the colours to little more than chiaro-oscuro,
which was often the practice of the Bolognian
schools; and the other, by making the colours very distinct
and forcible, such as we see in those of Rome and Florence;
but still, the presiding principle of both those manners is
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
simplicity. Certainly, nothing can be more simple than
monotony; and the distinct blue, red, and yellow colours
which are seen in the draperies of the Roman and Florentine
schools, though they have not that kind of harmony
which is produced by a variety of broken and transparent
colours, have that effect of grandeur which was intended.
Perhaps these distinct colours strike the mind more forcibly,
from there not being any great union between them; as
martial music, which is intended to rouse the nobler passions,
has its effect from the sudden and strongly-marked transitions
from one note to another which that style of music
requires; whilst in that which is intended to move the
softer passions, the notes imperceptibly melt into one
another.</p>

<p>In the same manner as the historical painter never enters
into the detail of colours, so neither does he debase his
conceptions with minute attention to the discriminations of
drapery. It is the inferior style that marks the variety of
stuffs. With him the clothing is neither woollen, nor linen,
nor silk, satin, or velvet: it is drapery; it is nothing more.
The art of disposing the foldings of the drapery makes a
very considerable part of the painter's study. To make it
merely natural is a mechanical operation, to which neither
genius nor taste are required; whereas it requires the
nicest judgment to dispose the drapery, so that the folds
shall have an easy communication, and gracefully follow
each other with such natural negligence as to look like the
effect of chance, and at the same time show the figure under
it to the utmost advantage.</p>

<p>Carlo Maratti was of opinion that the disposition of
drapery was a more difficult art than even that of drawing
the human figure; that a student might be more easily
taught the latter than the former; as the rules of drapery,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
he said, could not be so well ascertained as those for
delineating a correct form. This, perhaps, is a proof how
willingly we favour our own peculiar excellence. Carlo
Maratti is said to have valued himself particularly upon
his skill in this part of his art; yet in him, the disposition
appears so ostentatiously artificial, that he is inferior to
Raffaelle, even in that which gave him his best claim to
reputation.</p>

<p>Such is the great principle by which we must be directed
in the nobler branches of our art. Upon this principle, the
Roman, the Florentine, the Bolognese schools have formed
their practice; and by this they have deservedly obtained
the highest praise. These are the three great schools of the
world in the epic style. The best of the French school,
Poussin, Le Sueur, and Le Brun, have formed themselves
upon these models, and consequently may be said, though
Frenchmen, to be a colony from the Roman school. Next
to these, but in a very different style of excellence, we may
rank the Venetian, together with the Flemish and Dutch
schools; all professing to depart from the great purposes of
painting, and catching at applause by inferior qualities.</p>

<p>I am not ignorant that some will censure me for placing
the Venetians in this inferior class, and many of the
warmest admirers of painting will think them unjustly degraded;
but I wish not to be misunderstood. Though I can
by no means allow them to hold any rank with the nobler
schools of painting, they accomplished perfectly the thing
they attempted. But as mere elegance is their principal
object, as they seem more willing to dazzle than to affect, it
can be no injury to them to suppose that their practice is
useful only to its proper end. But what may heighten the
elegant may degrade the sublime. There is a simplicity,
and, I may add, severity, in the great manner, which is, I
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
am afraid, almost incompatible with this comparatively
sensual style.</p>

<p>Tintoret, Paul Veronese, and others of the Venetian
school, seem to have painted with no other purpose than to
be admired for their skill and expertness in the mechanism of
painting, and to make a parade of that art, which, as I before
observed, the higher style requires its followers to conceal.</p>

<p>In a conference of the French Academy, at which were
present Le Brun, Sabastian Bourdon, and all the eminent
Artists of that age, one of the Academicians desired
to have their opinion on the conduct of Paul Veronese,
who, though a painter of great consideration, had, contrary
to the strict rules of art, in his picture of Perseus
and Andromeda, represented the principal figure in
shade. To this question no satisfactory answer was then
given. But I will venture to say, that, if they had
considered the class of the Artist, and ranked him as an
ornamental Painter, there would have been no difficulty in
answering&mdash;"It was unreasonable to expect what was
never intended. His intention was solely to produce an
effect of light and shadow; everything was to be sacrificed
to that intent, and the capricious composition of that
picture suited very well with the style which he professed."</p>

<p>Young minds are indeed too apt to be captivated by this
splendour of style; and that of the Venetians is particularly
pleasing; for by them all those parts of the Art that
gave pleasure to the eye or sense have been cultivated with
care, and carried to the degree nearest to perfection. The
powers exerted in the mechanical part of the Art have been
called <i>the language of Painters</i>; but we may say, that it is
but poor eloquence which only shows that the orator can
talk. Words should be employed as the means, not as the
end: language is the instrument, conviction is the work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
    The language of Painting must indeed be allowed these
masters; but even in that they have shown more copiousness
than choice, and more luxuriancy than judgment. If
we consider the uninteresting subjects of their invention,
or at least the uninteresting manner in which they are
treated; if we attend to their capricious composition, their
violent and affected contrasts, whether of figures or of light
and shadow, the richness of their drapery, and, at the same
time, the mean effect which the discrimination of stuffs
gives to their pictures; if to these we add their total
inattention to expression; and then reflect on the
conceptions and the learning of Michel Angelo, or the
simplicity of Raffaelle, we can no longer dwell on the
comparison. Even in colouring, if we compare the quietness
and chastity of the Bolognese pencil to the bustle and
tumult that fills every part of a Venetian picture, without
the least attempt to interest the passions, their boasted art
will appear a mere struggle without effect; <i>a tale told by
an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing</i>.</p>

<p>Such as suppose that the great style might happily be
blended with the ornamental, that the simple, grave, and
majestic dignity of Raffaelle could unite with the glow and
bustle of a Paolo or Tintoret, are totally mistaken. The
principles by which each is attained are so contrary to each
other, that they seem, in my opinion, incompatible, and as
impossible to exist together, as that in the mind the most
sublime ideas and the lowest sensuality should at the same
time be united.</p>

<p>The subjects of the Venetian Painters are mostly such
as give them an opportunity of introducing a great number
of figures; such as feasts, marriages, and processions,
public martyrdoms, or miracles. I can easily conceive that
Paul Veronese, if he were asked, would say, that no
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
subject was proper for an historical picture, but such as
admitted at least forty figures; for in a less number, he
would assert, there could be no opportunity of the Painter's
showing his art in composition, his dexterity of managing
and disposing the masses of light and groups of figures, and
of introducing a variety of Eastern dresses and characters
in their rich stuffs.</p>

<p>But the thing is very different with a pupil of the
greater schools. Annibale Caracci thought twelve figures
sufficient for any story; he conceived that more would
contribute to no end but to fill space; that they would be
but cold spectators of the general action, or, to use his own
expression, that they would be <i>figures to be let</i>. Besides, it
is impossible for a picture composed of so many parts
to have that effect so indispensably necessary to grandeur,
that of one complete whole. However contradictory it may
be in geometry, it is true in taste, that many little things
will not make a great one. The Sublime impresses the
mind at once with one great idea; it is a single blow: the
Elegant, indeed, may be produced by repetition; by an
accumulation of many minute circumstances.</p>

<p>However great the difference is between the composition
of the Venetian and the rest of the Italian schools, there is
full as great a disparity in the effect of their pictures as
produced by colours. And though in this respect the
Venetians must be allowed extraordinary skill, yet even
that skill, as they have employed it, will but ill correspond
with the great style. Their colouring is not only too
brilliant, but, I will venture to say, too harmonious, to
produce that solidity, steadiness, and simplicity of effect,
which heroic subjects require, and which simple or grave
colours only can give to a work. That they are to be
cautiously studied by those who are ambitious of treading
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
the great walk of history, is confirmed, if it wants confirmation,
by the greatest of all authorities, Michel Angelo.
This wonderful man, after having seen a picture by Titian,
told Vasari, who accompanied him, "that he liked much
his colouring and manner;" but then he added, "that it
was a pity the Venetian painters did not learn to draw
correctly in their early youth, and adopt a better <i>manner of
study</i>."</p>

<p>By this it appears that the principal attention of the
Venetian painters, in the opinion of Michel Angelo, seemed
to be engrossed by the study of colours, to the neglect of
the <i>ideal beauty of form</i>, or propriety of expression. But
if general censure was given to that school from the sight
of a picture of Titian, how much more heavily and more
justly would the censure fall on Paolo Veronese, and more
especially on Tintoret? And here I cannot avoid citing
Vasari's opinion of the style and manner of Tintoret. "Of
all the extraordinary geniuses," says he, "that have practised
the art of painting, for wild, capricious, extravagant,
and fantastical inventions, for furious impetuosity and
boldness in the execution of his work, there is none like
Tintoret; his strange whimsies are even beyond extravagance;
and his works seem to be produced rather by
chance than in consequence of any previous design, as if he
wanted to convince the world that the art was a trifle, and
of the most easy attainment."</p>

<p>For my own part, when I speak of the Venetian painters,
I wish to be understood to mean Paolo Veronese and
Tintoret, to the exclusion of Titian; for though his style
is not so pure as that of many other of the Italian Schools,
yet there is a sort of senatorial dignity about him, which,
however awkward in his imitators, seems to become him
exceedingly. His portraits alone, from the nobleness and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
simplicity of character which he always gave them, will
entitle him to the greatest respect, as he undoubtedly
stands in the first rank in this branch of the art.</p>

<p>It is not with Titian, but with the seducing qualities of
the two former, that I could wish to caution you against
being too much captivated. These are the persons who
may be said to have exhausted all the powers of florid
eloquence, to debauch the young and unexperienced; and
have, without doubt, been the cause of turning off the
attention of the connoisseur and of the patron of art, as
well as that of the painter, from those higher excellencies
of which the art is capable, and which ought to be required
in every considerable production. By them, and their
imitators, a style merely ornamental has been disseminated
throughout all Europe. Rubens carried it to Flanders;
Voet to France; and Lucca Giordano to Spain and Naples.</p>

<p>The Venetian is indeed the most splendid of the schools
of elegance; and it is not without reason that the best
performances in this lower school are valued higher than
the second-rate performances of those above them; for
every picture has value when it has a decided character,
and is excellent in its kind. But the student must take
care not to be so much dazzled with this splendour as to be
tempted to imitate what must ultimately lead from perfection.
Poussin, whose eye was always steadily fixed on the
sublime, has been often heard to say, "that a particular
attention to colouring was an obstacle to the student, in his
progress to the great end and design of the art; and that
he who attaches himself to this principal end will acquire
by practice a reasonably good method of colouring."</p>

<p>Though it be allowed that elaborate harmony of colouring,
a brilliancy of tints, a soft and gradual transition from one
to another, present to the eye what an harmonious concert
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
of music does to the ear, it must be remembered that painting
is not merely a gratification of the sight. Such
excellence, though properly cultivated, where nothing
higher than elegance is intended, is weak and unworthy of
regard, when the work aspires to grandeur and sublimity.</p>

<p>The same reasons that have been urged to show that
a mixture of the Venetian style cannot improve the great
style, will hold good in regard to the Flemish and Dutch
schools. Indeed, the Flemish school, of which Rubens is
the head, was formed upon that of the Venetian; like them,
he took his figures too much from the people before him.
But it must be allowed in favour of the Venetians, that he
was more gross than they, and carried all their mistaken
methods to a far greater excess. In the Venetian school
itself, where they all err from the same cause, there is a
difference in the effect. The difference between Paolo and
Bassano seems to be only, that one introduced Venetian
gentlemen into his pictures, and the other the boors of the
district of Bassano, and called them patriarchs and prophets.</p>

<p>The painters of the Dutch school have still more locality.
With them a history-piece is properly a portrait of themselves;
whether they describe the inside or outside of their
houses, we have their own people engaged in their own
peculiar occupations; working or drinking, playing or fighting.
The circumstances that enter into a picture of this
kind are so far from giving a general view of human life,
that they exhibit all the minute particularities of a nation
differing in several respects from the rest of mankind. Yet
let them have their share of more humble praise. The
painters of this school are excellent in their own way; they
are only ridiculous when they attempt general history on
their own narrow principles, and debase great events by the
meanness of their characters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
    Some inferior dexterity, some extraordinary mechanical
power, is apparently that from which they seek distinction.
Thus, we see that school alone has the custom of representing
candle-light, not as it really appears to us by night, but
red, as it would illuminate objects to a spectator by day.
Such tricks, however pardonable in the little style, where
petty effects are the sole end, are inexcusable in the greater,
where the attention should never be drawn aside by trifles,
but should be entirely occupied by the subject itself.</p>

<p>The same local principles which characterise the Dutch
school extend even to their landscape painters; and
Rubens himself, who has painted many landscapes, has
sometimes transgressed in this particular. Their pieces in
this way are, I think, always a representation of an
individual spot, and each in its kind a very faithful but a
very confined portrait. Claude Lorrain, on the contrary,
was convinced that taking nature as he found it seldom
produced beauty. His pictures are a composition of the
various draughts which he had previously made from
various beautiful scenes and prospects. However, Rubens
in some measure has made amends for the deficiency with
which he is charged; he has contrived to raise and animate
his otherwise uninteresting views, by introducing a rainbow,
storm, or some particular accidental effect of light.
That the practice of Claude Lorrain, in respect to his
choice, is to be adopted by Landscape-painters in opposition
to that of the Flemish and Dutch schools, there can be no
doubt, as its truth is founded upon the same principle as
that by which the Historical-painter acquires perfect form.
But whether landscape-painting has a right to aspire so far
as to reject what the painters call Accidents of Nature, is
not easy to determine. It is certain Claude Lorrain
seldom, if ever, availed himself of those accidents; either
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
he thought that such peculiarities were contrary to that
style of general nature which he professed, or that it
would catch the attention too strongly, and destroy that
quietness and repose which he thought necessary to that
kind of painting.</p>

<p>A Portrait-painter likewise, when he attempts history,
unless he is upon his guard, is likely to enter too much into
the detail. He too frequently makes his historical heads
look like portraits; and this was once the custom amongst
those old painters, who revived the art before general ideas
were practised or understood. A History-painter paints
man in general; a Portrait-painter, a particular man, and
consequently a defective model.</p>

<p>Thus an habitual practice in the lower exercises of the
art will prevent many from attaining the greater. But
such of us who move in these humbler walks of the profession
are not ignorant that, as the natural dignity of the
subject is less, the more all the little ornamental helps are
necessary to its embellishment. It would be ridiculous for
a painter of domestic scenes, of portraits, landscapes,
animals, or still life, to say that he despised those qualities
which has made the subordinate schools so famous. The
art of colouring, and the skilful management of light and
shadow, are essential requisites in his confined labours. If
we descend still lower, what is the painter of fruit and
flowers without the utmost art in colouring, and what the
painters call handling; that is, a lightness of pencil that
implies great practice, and gives the appearance of being
done with ease? Some here, I believe, must remember a
flower-painter whose boast it was, that he scorned to paint
for the <i>million</i>: no, he professed to paint in the true
Italian taste; and, despising the crowd, called strenuously
upon the <i>few</i> to admire him. His idea of the Italian taste
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
was to paint as black and dirty as he could, and to leave all
clearness and brilliancy of colouring to those who were
fonder of money than immortality. The consequence was
such as might be expected. For these petty excellencies
are here essential beauties; and without this merit the
artist's work will be more short-lived than the objects of his
imitation.</p>

<p>From what has been advanced, we must now be convinced
that there are two distinct styles in History-painting:
the grand, and the splendid or ornamental.</p>

<p>The great style stands alone, and does not require,
perhaps does not so well admit, any addition from inferior
beauties. The ornamental style also possesses its own
peculiar merit. However, though the union of the two
may make a sort of composite style, yet that style is likely
to be more imperfect than either of those which go to its
composition. Both kinds have merit, and may be excellent
though in different ranks, if uniformity be preserved, and
the general and particular ideas of nature be not mixed.
Even the meanest of them is difficult enough to attain; and
the first place being already occupied by the great artists in
each department, some of those who followed thought there
was less room for them; and feeling the impulse of ambition
and the desire of novelty, and being at the same time,
perhaps, willing to take the shortest way, endeavoured to
make for themselves a place between both. This they have
effected by forming an union of the different orders. But as
the grave and majestic style would suffer by an union with
the florid and gay, so also has the Venetian ornament in
some respect been injured by attempting an alliance with
simplicity.</p>

<p>It may be asserted, that the great style is always more or
less contaminated by any meaner mixture. But it happens
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
in a few instances that the lower may be improved by
borrowing from the grand. Thus, if a Portrait-painter is
desirous to raise and improve his subject, he has no other
means than by approaching it to a general idea. He
leaves out all the minute breaks and peculiarities in the
face, and changes the dress from a temporary fashion to one
more permanent, which has annexed to it no ideas of meanness
from its being familiar to us. But if an exact resemblance
of an individual be considered as the sole object to be
aimed at, the Portrait-painter will be apt to lose more than
he gains by the acquired dignity taken from general nature.
It is very difficult to ennoble the character of a countenance
but at the expense of the likeness, which is what is most
generally required by such as sit to the painter.</p>

<p>Of those who have practised the composite style, and
have succeeded in this perilous attempt, perhaps the foremost
is Correggio. His style is founded upon modern grace
and elegance, to which is superadded something of the
simplicity of the grand style. A breadth of light and
colour, the general ideas of the drapery, an uninterrupted
flow of outline, all conspire to this effect. Next to him
(perhaps equal to him), Parmegiano has dignified the genteelness
of modern effeminacy, by uniting it with the simplicity
of the ancients and the grandeur and severity of Michel
Angelo. It must be confessed, however, that these two
extraordinary men, by endeavouring to give the utmost
degree of grace, have sometimes, perhaps, exceeded its boundaries,
and have fallen into the most hateful of all hateful
qualities&mdash;affectation. Indeed, it is the peculiar characteristic
of men of genius to be afraid of coldness and insipidity,
from which they think they never can be too far removed.
It particularly happens to these great masters of grace and
elegance. They often boldly drive on to the very verge of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
ridicule; the spectator is alarmed, but at the same time
admires their vigour and intrepidity:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Strange graces still, and stranger flights they had,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8195;&#8195;*&#8195;&#8195;*&#8195;&#8195;*
    &#8195;&#8195;*&#8195;&#8195;*&#8195;&#8195;*<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet ne'er so sure our passion to create,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As when they touch'd the brink of all we hate."<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>The errors of genius, however, are pardonable, and none
even of the more exalted painters are wholly free from
them; but they have taught us, by the rectitude of their
general practice, to correct their own affected or accidental
deviation. The very first have not been always upon their
guard, and perhaps there is not a fault but what may take
shelter under the most venerable authorities; yet that style
only is perfect, in which the noblest principles are
uniformly pursued; and those masters only are entitled to
the first rank in our estimation who have enlarged the
boundaries of their art, and have raised it to its highest
dignity, by exhibiting the general ideas of nature.</p>

<p>On the whole, it seems to me that there is but one
presiding principle which regulates and gives stability to
every art. The works, whether of poets, painters, moralists,
or historians, which are built upon general nature, live
for ever; while those which depend for their existence on
particular customs and habits, a partial view of nature, or
the fluctuation of fashion, can only be coeval with that
which first raised them from obscurity. Present time and
future may be considered as rivals; and he who solicits the
one must expect to be discountenanced by the other.</p>

</div>

<p>I purpose to carry on in this discourse the subject which I
began in my last. It was my wish upon that occasion to
incite you to pursue the higher excellencies of the art.
But I fear that in this particular I have been misunderstood.
Some are ready to imagine, when any of their
favourite acquirements in the art are properly classed, that
they are utterly disgraced. This is a very great mistake:
nothing has its proper lustre but in its proper place. That
which is most worthy of esteem in its allotted sphere, becomes
an object, not of respect, but of derision, when it is
forced into a higher, to which it is not suited; and there it
becomes doubly a source of disorder, by occupying a situation
which is not natural to it, and by putting down from
the first place what is in reality of too much magnitude to
become with grace and proportion that subordinate station,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
to which something of less value would be much better
suited.</p>

<p>My advice, in a word, is this:&mdash;Keep your principal
attention fixed upon the higher excellencies. If you compass
them, and compass nothing more, you are still in the
first class. We may regret the innumerable beauties which
you may want; you may be very imperfect: but still you
are an imperfect artist of the highest order.</p>

<p>If, when you have got thus far, you can add any, or all,
of the subordinate qualifications, it is my wish and advice
that you should not neglect them. But this is as much a
matter of circumspection and caution at least, as of
eagerness and pursuit.</p>

<p>The mind is apt to be distracted by a multiplicity of
objects; and that scale of perfection which I wish always
to be preserved, is in the greatest danger of being totally
disordered, and even inverted.</p>

<p>Some excellencies bear to be united, and are improved
by union; others are of a discordant nature; and the
attempt to join them only produces a harsh jarring of
incongruent principles. The attempt to unite contrary
excellencies (of form, for instance) in a single figure can
never escape degenerating into the monstrous, but by sinking
into the insipid; by taking away its marked character,
and weakening its expression.</p>

<p>This remark is true to a certain degree with regard to
the passions. If you mean to preserve the most perfect
beauty <i>in its most perfect state</i>, you cannot express the
passions, all of which produce distortion and deformity,
more or less, in the most beautiful faces.</p>

<p>Guido, from want of choice in adapting his subject to his
ideas and his powers, or from attempting to preserve beauty
where it could not be preserved, has in this respect
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
succeeded very ill. His figures are often engaged in subjects
that require great expression; yet his Judith and
Holofernes, the daughter of Herodias with the Baptist's
head, the Andromeda, and some even of the Mothers of the
Innocents, have little more expression than his Venus
attired by the Graces.</p>

<p>Obvious as these remarks appear, there are many writers
on our art, who, not being of the profession, and consequently
not knowing what can or cannot be done, have
been very liberal of absurd praises in their descriptions of
favourite works. They always find in them what they are
resolved to find. They praise excellencies that can hardly
exist together; and, above all things, are fond of describing,
with great exactness, the expression of a mixed passion,
which more particularly appears to me out of the reach of
our art.</p>

<p>Such are many disquisitions which I have read on some
of the Cartoons and other pictures of Raffaelle, where the
critics have described their own imaginations; or, indeed,
where the excellent master himself may have attempted
this expression of passions above the powers of the art, and
has, therefore, by an indistinct and imperfect marking, left
room for every imagination, with equal probability to find
a passion of his own. What has been, and what can be
done in the art, is sufficiently difficult; we need not be
mortified or discouraged at not being able to execute the
conceptions of a romantic imagination. Art has its boundaries,
though imagination has none. We can easily, like
the ancients, suppose a Jupiter to be possessed of all those
powers and perfections which the subordinate deities were
endowed with separately. Yet, when they employed their
art to represent him, they confined his character to majesty
alone. Pliny, therefore, though we are under great obligations
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
to him for the information he has given us in relation
to the works of the ancient artists, is very frequently
wrong when he speaks of them, which he does very often,
in the style of many of our modern connoisseurs. He
observes, that in a statue of Paris, by Euphranor, you
might discover, at the same time, three different characters;
the dignity of a Judge of the Goddesses, the Lover of
Helen, and the Conqueror of Achilles. A statue, in which
you endeavour to unite stately dignity, youthful elegance,
and stern valour, must surely possess none of these to any
eminent degree.</p>

<p>From hence it appears, that there is much difficulty, as
well as danger, in an endeavour to concentrate, in a single
subject, those various powers, which, rising from different
points, naturally move in different directions.</p>

<p>The summit of excellence seems to be an assemblage of
contrary qualities, but mixed in such proportions, that no
one part is found to counteract the other. How hard this
is to be attained in every art, those only know who have
made the greatest progress in their respective professions.</p>

<p>To conclude what I have to say on this part of the
subject, which I think of great importance, I wish you to
understand that I do not discourage the younger Students
from the noble attempt of uniting all the excellencies of art;
but suggest to them, that, beside the difficulties which
attend every arduous attempt, there is a peculiar difficulty
in the choice of the excellencies which ought to be united.
I wish to attend to this, that you may try yourselves, whenever
you are capable of that trial, what you can and what
you cannot do; and that, instead of dissipating your
natural faculties over the immense field of possible excellence,
you may choose some particular walk in which you
may exercise all your powers in order that each of you may
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
become the first in his way. If any man shall be master
of such a transcendent, commanding, and ductile genius,
as to enable him to rise to the highest, and to stoop to the
lowest, flights of art, and to sweep over all of them, unobstructed
and secure, he is fitter to give example than to
receive instruction.</p>

<p>Having said thus much on the <i>union</i> of excellencies, I
will next say something of the subordination in which
various excellencies ought to be kept.</p>

<p>I am of opinion that the ornamental style, which, in my
discourse of last year, I cautioned you against considering
as <i>principal</i>, may not be wholly unworthy the attention
even of those who aim at the grand style, when it is
properly placed and properly reduced.</p>

<p>But this study will be used with far better effect, if its
principles are employed in softening the harshness and
mitigating the rigour of the great style, than if it attempt
to stand forward with any pretensions of its own to
positive and original excellence. It was thus Ludovico
Caracci, whose example I formerly recommended to you,
employed it. He was acquainted with the works both
of Correggio and the Venetian painters, and knew the
principles by which they produced those pleasing effects,
which, at the first glance, prepossess us so much in their
favour; but he took only as much from each as would
embellish, but not overpower, that manly strength and
energy of style which is his peculiar character.</p>

<p>Since I have already expatiated so largely in my former
discourse, and in my present, upon the <i>styles</i> and <i>characters</i>
of Painting, it will not be at all unsuitable to my subject,
if I mention to you some particulars relative to the leading
principles, and capital works, of those who excelled in the
<i>great style</i>, that I may bring you from abstraction nearer
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
to practice, and, by exemplifying the positions which I
have laid down, enable you to understand more clearly
what I would enforce.</p>

<p>The principal works of modern art are in <i>Fresco</i>, a mode
of painting which excludes attention to minute elegancies:
yet these works in Fresco are the productions on which
the fame of the greatest masters depends. Such are the
pictures of Michel Angelo and Raffaelle in the Vatican; to
which we may add the Cartoons; which, though not
strictly to be called Fresco, yet may be put under that
denomination; and such are the works of Giulio Romano
at Mantua. If these performances were destroyed, with
them would be lost the best part of the reputation of those
illustrious painters; for these are justly considered as the
greatest effort of our art which the world can boast. To
these, therefore, we should principally direct our attention
for higher excellencies. As for the lower arts, as they have
been once discovered, they may be easily attained by those
possessed of the former.</p>

<p>Raffaelle, who stands in general foremost of the first
painters, owes his reputation, as I have observed, to his
excellence in the higher parts of the art; his works in
<i>Fresco</i>, therefore, ought to be the first object of our study
and attention. His easel-works stand in a lower degree of
estimation: for though he continually, to the day of his
death, embellished his performances more and more with
the addition of those lower ornaments, which entirely make
the merit of some painters, yet he never arrived at such
perfection as to make him an object of imitation. He
never was able to conquer perfectly that dryness, or even
littleness of manner, which he inherited from his master.
He never acquired that nicety of taste in colours, that
breadth of light and shadow, that art and management of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
uniting light to light, and shadow to shadow, so as to make
the object rise out of the ground, with the plenitude of
effect so much admired in the works of Correggio. When
he painted in oil, his hand seemed to be so cramped and
confined, that he not only lost that facility and spirit, but
I think even that correctness of form, which is so perfect
and admirable in his Fresco-works. I do not recollect any
pictures of his of this kind, except the Transfiguration, in
which there are not some parts that appear to be even
feebly drawn. That this is not a necessary attendant on
Oil-painting, we have abundant instances in more modern
painters. Ludovico Caracci, for instance, preserved in his
works in oil the same spirit, vigour, and correctness which
he had in Fresco. I have no desire to degrade Raffaelle
from the high rank which he deservedly holds; but by
comparing him with himself, he does not appear to me to
be the same man in Oil as in Fresco.</p>

<p>From those who have ambition to tread in this great
walk of the art, Michel Angelo claims the next attention.
He did not possess so many excellencies as Raffaelle, but
those which he had were of the highest kind. He considered
the art as consisting of little more than what may
be attained by sculpture; correctness of form and energy
of character. We ought not to expect more than an artist
intends in his work. He never attempted those lesser
elegancies and graces in the art. Vasari says he never
painted but one picture in oil, and resolved never to paint
another, saying it was an employment only fit for women
and children.</p>

<p>If any man had a right to look down upon the lower
accomplishments as beneath his attention, it was certainly
Michel Angelo: nor can it be thought strange that such a
mind should have slighted or have been withheld from
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
paying due attention to all those graces and embellishments
of art which have diffused such lustre over the works of
other painters.</p>

<p>It must be acknowledged, however, that together with
these, which we wish he had more attended to, he has rejected
all the false, though specious ornaments, which disgrace the
works even of the most esteemed artists; and I will venture
to say, that when those higher excellencies are more known
and cultivated by the artists and the patrons of arts, his
fame and credit will increase with our increasing knowledge.
His name will then be held in the same veneration as it was
in the enlightened age of Leo the Tenth: and it is remarkable
that the reputation of this truly great man has been
continually declining as the art itself has declined. For I
must remark to you, that it has long been much on the
decline, and that our only hope of its revival will consist in
your being thoroughly sensible of its deprivation and decay.
It is to Michel Angelo that we owe even the existence of
Raffaelle; it is to him Raffaelle owes the grandeur of his
style. He was taught by him to elevate his thoughts, and
to conceive his subjects with dignity. His genius, however,
formed to blaze and shine, might, like fire in combustible
matter, forever have lain dormant, if it had not caught a
spark by its contact with Michel Angelo; and though it
never burst out with <i>his</i> extraordinary heat and vehemence,
yet it must be acknowledged to be a more pure, regular, and
chaste flame. Though our judgment must, upon the whole,
decide in favour of Raffaelle, yet he never takes such a
firm hold and entire possession of the mind as to make
us desire nothing else, and to feel nothing wanting. The
effect of the capital works of Michel Angelo perfectly corresponds
to what Bouchardon said he felt from reading
Homer; his whole frame appeared to himself to be
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
enlarged, and all nature which surrounded him, diminished
to atoms.</p>

<p>If we put these great artists in a light of comparison with
each other, Raffaelle had more Taste and Fancy, Michel
Angelo more Genius and Imagination. The one excelled
in beauty, the other in energy. Michel Angelo has more of
the poetical Inspiration; his ideas are vast and sublime;
his people are a superior order of beings; there is nothing
about them, nothing in the air of their actions, or their
attitudes, or the style and cast of their limbs or features,
that reminds us of their belonging to our own species.
Raffaelle's imagination is not so elevated; his figures are
not so much disjoined from our own diminutive race of
beings, though his ideas are chaste, noble, and of great
conformity to their subjects. Michel Angelo's works have
a strong, peculiar, and marked character; they seem to
proceed from his own mind entirely, and that mind so rich
and abundant, that he never needed, or seemed to disdain,
to look abroad for foreign help. Raffaelle's materials are
generally borrowed, though the noble structure is his own.
The excellency of this extraordinary man lay in the propriety,
beauty, and majesty of his characters, the judicious
contrivance of his Composition, his correctness of Drawing,
purity of Taste, and skilful accommodation of other men's
conception's to his own purpose. Nobody excelled him in
that judgment, with which he united to his own observations
on Nature the energy of Michel Angelo and the Beauty
and Simplicity of the Antique. To the question, therefore,
which ought to hold the first rank, Raffaelle or Michel
Angelo, it must be answered, that if it is to be given to him
who possessed a greater combination of the higher qualities
of the art than any other man, there is no doubt but
Raffaelle is the first. But if, as Longinus thinks, the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
sublime, being the highest excellence that human composition
can attain to, abundantly compensates the absence of every
other beauty, and atones for all other deficiencies, then
Michel Angelo demands the preference.</p>

<p>These two extraordinary men carried some of the higher
excellencies of the art to a greater degree of perfection than
probably they ever arrived at before. They certainly have
not been excelled, nor equalled since. Many of their successors
were induced to leave this great road as a beaten
path, endeavouring to surprise and please by something uncommon
or new. When this desire of novelty has proceeded
from mere idleness or caprice, it is not worth the
trouble of criticism; but when it has been the result of a
busy mind of a peculiar complexion, it is always striking
and interesting, never insipid.</p>

<p>Such is the great style, as it appears in those who
possessed it at its height; in this, search after novelty, in
conception or in treating the subject, has no place.</p>

<p>But there is another style, which, though inferior to the
former, has still great merit, because it shows that those
who cultivated it were men of lively and vigorous imagination.
This, which may be called the original or characteristical
style, being less referred to any true archetype
existing either in general or particular nature, must be
supported by the painter's consistency in the principles
which he has assumed, and in the union and harmony of
his whole design. The excellency of every style, but of the
subordinate styles more especially, will very much depend
on preserving that union and harmony between all the
component parts, that they may appear to hang well
together, as if the whole proceeded from one mind. It is
in the works of art as in the characters of men. The
faults or defects of some men seem to become them when
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
they appear to be the natural growth, and of a piece with
the rest of their character. A faithful picture of a mind,
though it be not of the most elevated kind, though it be
irregular, wild, and incorrect, yet if it be marked with that
spirit and firmness which characterise works of genius, will
claim attention, and be more striking than a combination
of excellencies that do not seem to unite well together; or
we may say, than a work that possesses even all excellencies,
but those in a moderate degree.</p>

<p>One of the strongest-marked characters of this kind,
which must be allowed to be subordinate to the great style,
is that of Salvator Rosa. He gives us a peculiar cast of
nature, which, though void of all grace, elegance, and
simplicity, though it has nothing of that elevation and
dignity which belongs to the grand style, yet has that sort
of dignity which belongs to savage and uncultivated
nature: but what is most to be admired in him is the
perfect correspondence which he observed between the
subjects which he chose and his manner of treating them.
Everything is of a piece: his Rocks, Trees, Sky, even to his
handling, have the same rude and wild character which
animates his figures.</p>

<p>With him we may contrast the character of Carlo
Maratti, who, in my opinion, had no great vigour of mind
or strength of original genius. He rarely seizes the
imagination by exhibiting the higher excellencies, nor does
he captivate us by that originality which attends the
painter who thinks for himself. He knew and practised all
the rules of art, and from a composition of Raffaelle,
Caracci, and Guido, made up a style, of which the only
fault was, that it had no manifest defects and no striking
beauties; and that the principles of his composition are
never blended together so as to form one uniform body,
original in its kind, or excellent in any view.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
    I will mention two other painters, who, though entirely
dissimilar, yet, by being each consistent with himself, and
possessing a manner entirely his own, have both gained
reputation, though for very opposite accomplishments. The
painters I mean are Rubens and Poussin. Rubens I
mention in this place, as I think him a remarkable instance
of the same mind being seen in all the various parts of the
art. The whole is so much of a piece, that one can scarce
be brought to believe but that if any one of the qualities
he possessed had been more correct and perfect, his works
would not have been so complete as they now appear. If
we should allow him a greater purity and correctness of
Drawing, his want of Simplicity in Composition, Colouring,
and Drapery, would appear more gross.</p>

<p>In his Composition his art is too apparent. His figures
have expression, and act with energy, but without
simplicity or dignity. His colouring, in which he is
eminently skilled, is, notwithstanding, too much of what we
call tinted. Throughout the whole of his works there is a
proportionable want of that nicety of distinction and
elegance of mind, which is required in the higher walks of
painting; and to this want it may be in some degree
ascribed, that those qualities which make the excellency of
this subordinate style appear in him with their greatest
lustre. Indeed, the facility with which he invented, the
richness of his composition, the luxuriant harmony and
brilliancy of his colouring, so dazzle the eye, that whilst his
works continue before us, we cannot help thinking that all
his deficiencies are fully supplied.</p>

<p>Opposed to this florid, careless, loose, and inaccurate
style, that of the simple, careful, pure, and correct style of
Poussin seems to be a complete contrast. Yet however
opposite their characters, in one thing they agreed; both of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
them always preserving a perfect correspondence between
all the parts of their respective manners; insomuch that it
may be doubted whether any alteration of what is considered
as defective in either would not destroy the effect of the
whole.</p>

<p>Poussin lived and conversed with the ancient statues so
long that he may be said to have been better acquainted
with them than with the people who were about him. I
have often thought that he carried his veneration for them
so far as to wish to give his works the air of Ancient Paintings.
It is certain he copied some of the Antique Paintings,
particularly the Marriage in the Aldobrandini Palace at
Rome, which I believe to be the best relic of those remote
ages that has yet been found.</p>

<p>No works of any modern have so much of the air of
Antique Painting as those of Poussin. His best performances
have a remarkable dryness of manner, which though
by no means to be recommended for imitation, yet seems
perfectly correspondent to that ancient simplicity which
distinguishes his style. Like Polidoro, he studied the
ancients so much that he acquired a habit of thinking in
their way, and seemed to know perfectly the actions and
gestures they would use on every occasion.</p>

<p>Poussin in the latter part of his life changed from his
dry manner to one much softer and richer, where there is a
greater union between the figures and ground; as in the
Seven Sacraments in the Duke of Orlean's collection; but
neither these, or any of his other pictures in this manner,
are at all comparable to many in this dry manner which we
have in England.</p>

<p>The favourite subjects of Poussin were Ancient Fables;
and no painter was ever better qualified to paint such
subjects, not only from his being eminently skilled in the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
knowledge of the ceremonies, customs, and habits of the
Ancients, but from his being so well acquainted with the
different characters which those who invented them gave to
their allegorical figures. Though Rubens has shown great
fancy in his Satyrs, Silenuses, and Fauns, yet they are not
that distinct separate class of beings, which is carefully
exhibited by the Ancients, and by Poussin. Certainly,
when such subjects of antiquity are represented, nothing in
the picture ought to remind us of modern times. The mind
is thrown back into antiquity, and nothing ought to be
introduced that may tend to awaken it from the illusion.</p>

<p>Poussin seemed to think that the style and the language
in which such stories are told, is not the worse for preserving
some relish of the old way of painting, which seemed to
give a general uniformity to the whole, so that the mind
was thrown back into antiquity not only by the subject, but
the execution.</p>

<p>If Poussin, in imitation of the Ancients, represents
Apollo driving his chariot out of the sea by way of representing
the Sun rising, if he personifies Lakes and Rivers,
it is nowise offensive in him; but seems perfectly of a
piece with the general air of the picture. On the contrary,
if the figures which people his pictures had a modern air or
countenance, if they appeared like our countrymen, if the
draperies were like cloth or silk of our manufacture, if the
landscape had the appearance of a modern view, how
ridiculous would Apollo appear instead of the Sun; and an
old Man, or a nymph with an urn, to represent a River or
a Lake?</p>

<p>I cannot avoid mentioning here a circumstance in portrait-painting
which may help to confirm what has been said.
When a portrait is painted in the Historical Style, as it is
neither an exact minute representation of an individual,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
nor completely ideal, every circumstance ought to correspond
to this mixture. The simplicity of the antique air
and attitude, however much to be admired, is ridiculous
when joined to a figure in a modern dress. It is not to my
purpose to enter into the question at present, whether this
mixed style ought to be adopted or not; yet if it is chosen,
it is necessary it should be complete, and all of a piece; the
difference of stuffs, for instance, which make the clothing,
should be distinguished in the same degree as the head
deviates from a general idea. Without this union, which I
have so often recommended, a work can have no marked
and determined character, which is the peculiar and constant
evidence of genius. But when this is accomplished to
a high degree, it becomes in some sort a rival to that style
which we have fixed as the highest.</p>

<p>Thus I have given a sketch of the characters of Rubens
and Salvator Rosa, as they appear to me to have the
greatest uniformity of mind throughout their whole work.
But we may add to these, all those Artists who are at the
head of a class, and have had a school of imitators from
Michel Angelo down to Watteau. Upon the whole it
appears that, setting aside the Ornamental Style, there are
two different modes, either of which a Student may adopt
without degrading the dignity of his art. The object of the
first is to combine the higher excellencies and embellish
them to the greatest advantage; of the other, to carry one
of these excellencies to the highest degree. But those who
possess neither must be classed with them, who, as
Shakespeare says, are <i>men of no mark or likelihood</i>.</p>

<p>I inculcate as frequently as I can your forming yourselves
upon great principles and great models. Your time will be
much misspent in every other pursuit. Small excellencies
should be viewed, not studied; they ought to be viewed,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
because nothing ought to escape a Painter's observation:
but for no other reason.</p>

<p>There is another caution which I wish to give you. Be
as select in those whom you endeavour to please, as in
those whom you endeavour to imitate. Without the love
of fame you can never do anything excellent; but by an
excessive and undistinguishing thirst after it, you will come
to have vulgar views; you will degrade your style; and
your taste will be entirely corrupted. It is certain that the
lowest style will be the most popular, as it falls within the
compass of ignorance itself; and the Vulgar will always
be pleased with what is natural, in the confined and
misunderstood sense of the word.</p>

<p>One would wish that such depravation of taste should
be counteracted with that manly pride which actuated
Euripides when he said to the Athenians who criticised his
works, "I do not compose my works in order to be
corrected by you, but to instruct you." It is true, to have
a right to speak thus, a man must be an Euripides. However,
thus much may be allowed, that when an Artist is
sure that he is upon firm ground, supported by the
authority and practice of his predecessors of the greatest
reputation, he may then assume the boldness and intrepidity
of genius; at any rate he must not be tempted out of the
right path by any allurement of popularity, which always
accompanies the lower styles of painting.</p>

<p>I mention this, because our Exhibitions, while they
produce such admirable effects by nourishing emulation,
and calling out genius, have also a mischievous tendency,
by seducing the Painter to an ambition of pleasing
indiscriminately the mixed multitude of people who resort
to them.</p>

<h2>DISCOURSE VI.</h2>

<p class="center"><i>Delivered to the Students of the Royal Academy, on the Distribution

OTHERS.&mdash;THE TRUE METHOD OF IMITATING.&mdash;BORROWING,
HOW FAR ALLOWABLE.&mdash;SOMETHING TO BE GATHERED FROM

</div>

<p>When I have taken the liberty of addressing you on the
course and order of your studies, I never proposed to enter
into a minute detail of the art. This I have always left to
the several Professors, who pursue the end of our institution
with the highest honour to themselves, and with the greatest
advantage to the Students.</p>

<p>My purpose in the discourses I have held in the Academy
has been to lay down certain general positions, which seem
to me proper for the formation of a sound taste: principles
necessary to guard the pupils against those errors into
which the sanguine temper common to their time of life has
a tendency to lead them: and which have rendered abortive
the hopes of so many successions of promising young men
in all parts of Europe. I wished also, to intercept and
suppress those prejudices which particularly prevail when
the mechanism of painting is come to its perfection; and
which, when they do prevail, are certain utterly to destroy
the higher and more valuable parts of this literate and
liberal profession.</p>

<p>These two have been my principal purposes; they are
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
still as much my concern as ever; and if I repeat my own
notions on the subject, you who know how fast mistake and
prejudice, when neglected, gain ground upon truth and
reason, will easily excuse me. I only attempt to set the
same thing in the greatest variety of lights.</p>

<p>The subject of this discourse will be <span class="smcap">Imitation</span>, as far as
a painter is concerned in it. By imitation, I do not mean
imitation in its largest sense, but simply the following of
other masters, and the advantage to be drawn from the
study of their works.</p>

<p>Those who have undertaken to write on our art, and
have represented it as a kind of <i>inspiration</i>, as a <i>gift</i>
bestowed upon peculiar favourites at their birth, seem to
insure a much more favourable disposition from their
readers, and have a much more captivating and liberal air,
than he who attempts to examine, coldly, whether there are
any means by which this art may be acquired; how the
mind may be strengthened and expanded, and what guides
will show the way to eminence.</p>

<p>It is very natural for those who are unacquainted with
the <i>cause</i> of anything extraordinary to be astonished at the
<i>effect</i>, and to consider it as a kind of magic. They, who
have never observed the gradation by which art is acquired;
who see only what is the full result of long labour and
application of an infinite number and infinite variety of
acts, are apt to conclude, from their entire inability to do
the same at once, that it is not only inaccessible to themselves,
but can be done by those only who have some gift of
the nature of inspiration bestowed upon them.</p>

<p>The travellers into the East tell us, that when the
ignorant inhabitants of those countries are asked concerning
the ruins of stately edifices yet remaining amongst
them, the melancholy monuments of their former grandeur
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
and long-lost science, they always answer that they were
built by magicians. The untaught mind finds a vast gulf
between its own powers and those works of complicated
art, which it is utterly unable to fathom; and it supposes
that such a void can be passed only by supernatural
powers.</p>

<p>And, as for artists themselves, it is by no means their
interest to undeceive such judges, however conscious they
may be of the very natural means by which their extraordinary
powers were acquired; though our art, being
intrinsically imitative, rejects this idea of inspiration, more
perhaps than any other.</p>

<p>It is to avoid this plain confession of the truth, as
it should seem, that this imitation of masters, indeed almost
all imitation, which implies a more regular and progressive
method of attaining the ends of painting, has ever been
particularly inveighed against with great keenness, both
by ancient and modern writers.</p>

<p>To derive all from native power, to owe nothing to
another, is the praise which men who do not much think on
what they are saying, bestow sometimes upon others, and
sometimes on themselves; and their imaginary dignity is
naturally heightened by a supercilious censure of the low,
the barren, the groveling, the servile imitator. It would
be no wonder if a student, frightened by these terrific and
disgraceful epithets, with which the poor imitators are so
often loaded, should let fall his pencil in mere despair
(conscious as he must be, how much he has been indebted
to the labours of others), how little, how very little of his
art was born with him; and consider it as hopeless, to set
about acquiring by the imitation of any human master,
what he is taught to suppose is matter of inspiration from
heaven.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
    Some allowance must be made for what is said in the
gaiety of rhetoric. We cannot suppose that any one can
really mean to exclude all imitation of others. A position
so wild would scarce deserve a serious answer; for it is
apparent, if we were forbid to make use of the advantages
which our predecessors afford us, the art would be always
to begin, and consequently remain always in its infant
state; and it is a common observation, that no art was
ever invented and carried to perfection at the same time.</p>

<p>But to bring us entirely to reason and sobriety, let it be
observed, that a painter must not only be of necessity an
imitator of the works of nature, which alone is sufficient to
dispel this phantom of inspiration, but he must be as
necessarily an imitator of the works of other painters; this
appears more humiliating, but is equally true; and no man
can be an artist, whatever he may suppose, upon any other
terms.</p>

<p>However, those who appear more moderate and reasonable,
allow, that our study is to begin by imitation; but
maintain that we should no longer use the thoughts of our
predecessors, when we are become able to think for ourselves.
They hold that imitation is as hurtful to the more
advanced student, as it was advantageous to the beginner.</p>

<p>For my own part, I confess, I am not only very much
disposed to maintain the absolute necessity of imitation
in the first stages of the art; but am of opinion that the
study of other masters, which I here call imitation, may be
extended throughout our whole lives, without any danger
of the inconveniences with which it is charged, of enfeebling
the mind, or preventing us from giving that original
air which every work undoubtedly ought always to have.</p>

<p>I am on the contrary persuaded that by imitation only,
variety, and even originality of invention, is produced. I
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
will go further; even genius, at least what generally is so
called, is the child of imitation. But as this appears to be
contrary to the general opinion, I must explain my position
before I enforce it.</p>

<p>Genius is supposed to be a power of producing excellencies
which are out of the reach of the rules of art; a power
which no precepts can teach, and which no industry can
acquire.</p>

<p>This opinion of the impossibility of acquiring those
beauties, which stamp the work with the character of
genius, supposes that it is something more fixed than in
reality it is; and that we always do, and ever did agree in
opinion, with respect to what should be considered as the
characteristic of genius. But the truth is, that the <i>degree</i>
of excellence which proclaims <i>Genius</i> is different, in
different times and different places; and what shows it to
be so is, that mankind have often changed their opinion
upon this matter.</p>

<p>When the Arts were in their infancy the power of merely
drawing the likeness of any object was considered as one of
its greatest efforts. The common people, ignorant of the
principles of art, talk the same language even to this day.
But when it was found that every man could be taught to
do this, and a great deal more, merely by the observance of
certain precepts; the name of Genius then shifted its
application, and was given only to him who added the
peculiar character of the object he represented; to him
who had invention, expression, grace, or dignity; in short,
those qualities, or excellencies, the power of producing
which could not <i>then</i> be taught by any known and
promulgated rules.</p>

<p>We are very sure that the beauty of form, the expression
of the passions, the art of composition, even the power of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
giving a general air of grandeur to a work, is at present
very much under the dominion of rules. These excellencies
were, heretofore, considered merely as the effect
of genius; and justly, if genius is not taken for inspiration,
but as the effect of close observation and experience.</p>

<p>He who first made any of these observations, and
digested them, so as to form an invariable principle for
himself to work by, had that merit, but probably no one
went very far at once; and generally, the first who gave the
hint, did not know how to pursue it steadily and methodically;
at least not in the beginning. He himself worked
on it, and improved it; others worked more, and improved
further; until the secret was discovered, and the practice
made as general as refined practice can be made. How
many more principles may be fixed and ascertained we
cannot tell; but as criticism is likely to go hand in hand
with the art which is its subject, we may venture to say,
that as that art shall advance, its powers will be still more
and more fixed by rules.</p>

<p>But by whatever strides criticism may gain ground, we
need be under no apprehension that invention will ever be
annihilated or subdued; or intellectual energy be brought
entirely within the restraint of written law. Genius will
still have room enough to expatiate, and keep always at
the same distance from narrow comprehension and
mechanical performance.</p>

<p>What we now call Genius begins, not where rules
abstractedly taken end, but where known vulgar and trite
rules have no longer any place. It must of necessity be,
that even works of Genius, like every other effect, as they
must have their cause, must likewise have their rules; it
cannot be by chance that excellencies are produced with
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
any constancy or any certainty, for this is not the nature
of chance; but the rules by which men of extraordinary
parts, and such as are called men of Genius, work, are
either such as they discover by their own peculiar observations,
or of such a nice texture as not easily to admit being
expressed in words; especially as artists are not very
frequently skilful in that mode of communicating ideas.
Unsubstantial, however, as these rules may seem, and
difficult as it may be to convey them in writing, they are
still seen and felt in the mind of the artist; and he works
from them with as much certainty, as if they were
embodied, as I may say, upon paper. It is true, these
refined principles cannot be always made palpable, like the
more gross rules of art; yet it does not follow, but that the
mind may be put in such a train, that it shall perceive, by
a kind of scientific sense, that propriety, which words,
particularly words of unpractised writers, such as we are,
can but very feebly suggest.</p>

<p>Invention is one of the great marks of genius; but if we
consult experience, we shall find that it is by being conversant
with the inventions of others, that we learn to
invent; as by reading the thoughts of others we learn to
think.</p>

<p>Whoever has so far formed his taste, as to be able to
relish and feel the beauties of the great masters, has gone a
great way in his study; for, merely from a consciousness of
this relish of the right, the mind swells with an inward
pride, and is almost as powerfully affected as if it had
itself produced what it admires. Our hearts, frequently
warmed in this manner by the contact of those whom we
wish to resemble, will undoubtedly catch something of
their way of thinking; and we shall receive in our own
bosoms some radiation at least of their fire and splendour.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
That disposition, which is so strong in children, still continues
with us, of catching involuntarily the general air
and manner of those with whom we are most conversant;
with this difference only, that a young mind is naturally
pliable and imitative; but in a more advanced state it
grows rigid, and must be warmed and softened before it
will receive a deep impression.</p>

<p>From these considerations, which a little of your own
reflection will carry a great way further, it appears, of what
great consequence it is, that our minds should be habituated
to the contemplation of excellence; and that, far from
being contented to make such habits the discipline of our
youth only, we should, to the last moment of our lives,
continue a settled intercourse with all the true examples of
grandeur. Their inventions are not only the food of our
infancy, but the substance which supplies the fullest
maturity of our vigour.</p>

<p>The mind is but a barren soil&mdash;a soil which is soon
exhausted, and will produce no crop, or only one, unless it
be continually fertilised and enriched with foreign matter.</p>

<p>When we have had continually before us the great works
of Art to impregnate our minds with kindred ideas, we are
then, and not till then, fit to produce something of the
same species. We behold all about us with the eyes of
those penetrating observers whose works we contemplate;
and our minds, accustomed to think the thoughts of the
noblest and brightest intellects, are prepared for the
discovery and selection of all that is great and noble in
nature. The greatest natural genius cannot subsist on its
own stock: he who resolves never to ransack any mind but
his own, will be soon reduced, from mere barrenness, to the
poorest of all imitations; he will be obliged to imitate
himself, and to repeat what he has before often repeated.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
When we know the subject designed by such men, it
will never be difficult to guess what kind of work is to be
produced.</p>

<p>It is vain for painters or poets to endeavour to invent
without materials on which the mind may work, and from
which invention must originate. Nothing can come of
nothing.</p>

<p>Homer is supposed to be possessed of all the learning of
his time; and we are certain that Michel Angelo and
Raffaelle were equally possessed of all the knowledge in
the art which had been discovered in the works of their
predecessors.</p>

<p>A mind enriched by an assemblage of all the treasures of
ancient and modern art will be more elevated and fruitful
in resources, in proportion to the number of ideas which
have been carefully collected and thoroughly digested.
There can be no doubt but that he who has the most
materials has the greatest means of invention; and if he
has not the power of using them, it must proceed from a
feebleness of intellect; or from the confused manner in
which those collections have been laid up in his mind.</p>

<p>The addition of other men's judgment is so far from
weakening our own, as is the opinion of many, that it will
fashion and consolidate those ideas of excellence which lay
in embryo&mdash;feeble, ill-shaped, and confused&mdash;but which are
finished and put in order by the authority and practice of
those whose works may be said to have been consecrated by
having stood the test of ages.</p>

<p>The mind, or genius, has been compared to a spark of
fire, which is smothered by a heap of fuel, and prevented
from blazing into a flame. This simile, which is made use
of by the younger Pliny, may be easily mistaken for argument
or proof. But there is no danger of the mind being
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
overburthened with knowledge, or the genius extinguished
by any addition of images; on the contrary, these acquisitions
may as well, perhaps better, be compared, if comparisons
signified anything in reasoning, to the supply of living
embers, which will contribute to strengthen the spark, that
without the association of more fuel would have died away.
The truth is, he whose feebleness is such, as to make other
men's thoughts an incumbrance to him, can have no very
great strength of mind or genius of his own to be destroyed;
so that not much harm will be done at worst.</p>

<p>We may oppose to Pliny the greater authority of Cicero,
who is continually enforcing the necessity of this method of
study. In his dialogue on Oratory, he makes Crassus say,
that one of the first and most important precepts is, to
choose a proper model for our imitation. <i>Hoc sit primum
in pr&oelig;ceptis meis, ut demonstremus quem imitemur.</i></p>

<p>When I speak of the habitual imitation and continued
study of masters, it is not to be understood that I advise
any endeavour to copy the exact peculiar colour and complexion
of another man's mind; the success of such an
attempt must always be like his, who imitates exactly the
air, manner, and gestures of him whom he admires. His
model may be excellent, but the copy will be ridiculous;
this ridicule does not arise from his having imitated, but
from his not having chosen the right mode of imitation.</p>

<p>It is a necessary and warrantable pride to disdain to walk
servilely behind any individual, however elevated his rank.
The true and liberal ground of imitation is an open field;
where, though he who precedes has had the advantage of
starting before you, you may always propose to overtake
him; it is enough, however, to pursue his course; you need
not tread in his footsteps, and you certainly have a right to
outstrip him if you can.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
    Nor whilst I recommend studying the art from artists,
can I be supposed to mean that nature is to be neglected;
I take this study in aid, and not in exclusion of the
other. Nature is and must be the fountain which alone
is inexhaustible, and from which all excellencies must
originally flow.</p>

<p>The great use of studying our predecessors is, to open the
mind, to shorten our labour, and to give us the result of
the selection made by those great minds of what is grand
or beautiful in nature; her rich stores are all spread out
before us; but it is an art, and no easy art, to know how
or what to choose, and how to attain and secure the object
of our choice. Thus, the highest beauty of form must be
taken from nature; but it is an art of long deduction and
great experience to know how to find it. We must not
content ourselves with merely admiring and relishing; we
must enter into the principles on which the work is
wrought: these do not swim on the superficies, and
consequently are not open to superficial observers.</p>

<p>Art in its perfection is not ostentatious; it lies hid and
works its effect, itself unseen. It is the proper study and
labour of an artist to uncover and find out the latent cause
of conspicuous beauties, and from thence form principles of
his own conduct: such an examination is a continual
exertion of the mind; as great, perhaps, as that of the
artist whose works he is thus studying.</p>

<p>The sagacious imitator does not content himself with
merely remarking what distinguishes the different manner
or genius of each master; he enters into the contrivance
in the composition, how the masses of lights are disposed,
the means by which the effect is produced, how artfully
some parts are lost in the ground, others boldly relieved,
and how all these are mutually altered and interchanged
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
according to the reason and scheme of the work. He
admires not the harmony of colouring alone, but examines
by what artifice one colour is a foil to its neighbour. He
looks close into the tints, examines of what colours they
are composed, till he has formed clear and distinct ideas,
and has learnt to see in what harmony and good colouring
consists. What is learnt in this manner from the works of
others becomes really our own, sinks deep, and is never
forgotten; nay, it is by seizing on this clue that we proceed
forward, and get further and further in enlarging the
principles and improving the practice of our art.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt but the art is better learnt from the
works themselves, than from the precepts which are
formed upon those works; but if it is difficult to choose
proper models for imitation, it requires no less circumspection
to separate and distinguish what in those models
we ought to imitate.</p>

<p>I cannot avoid mentioning here, though it is not my
intention at present to enter into the art and method of
study, an error which students are too apt to fall into.
He that is forming himself must look with great caution
and wariness on those peculiarities, or prominent parts,
which at first force themselves upon view; and are the
marks, or what is commonly called the manner, by which
that individual artist is distinguished.</p>

<p>Peculiar marks I hold to be, generally, if not always,
defects; however difficult it may be wholly to escape
them.</p>

<p>Peculiarities in the works of art are like those in the
human figure; it is by them that we are cognisable, and
distinguished one from another, but they are always so
many blemishes; which, however, both in real life and in
painting, cease to appear deformities to those who have
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
them continually before their eyes. In the works of art,
even the most enlightened mind, when warmed by beauties
of the highest kind, will by degrees find a repugnance
within him to acknowledge any defects; nay, his enthusiasm
will carry him so far, as to transform them into
beauties and objects of imitation.</p>

<p>It must be acknowledged that a peculiarity of style,
either from its novelty or by seeming to proceed from a
peculiar turn of mind, often escapes blame; on the contrary,
it is sometimes striking and pleasing; but this it is
a vain labour to endeavour to imitate, because novelty and
peculiarity being its only merit, when it ceases to be new
it ceases to have value.</p>

<p>A manner, therefore, being a defect, and every painter,
however excellent, having a manner, it seems to follow that
all kinds of faults, as well as beauties, may be learned under
the sanction of the greatest authorities. Even the great
name of Michel Angelo may be used, to keep in countenance
a deficiency, or rather neglect, of colouring, and
every other ornamental part of the art. If the young
student is dry and hard, Poussin is the same. If his work
has a careless and unfinished air, he has most of the Venetian
school to support him. If he makes no selection of
objects, but takes individual nature just as he finds it, he
is like Rembrandt. If he is incorrect in the proportions
of his figures, Correggio was likewise incorrect. If his
colours are not blended and united, Rubens was equally
crude. In short, there is no defect that may not be
excused, if it is a sufficient excuse that it can be imputed
to considerable artists; but it must be remembered, that
it was not by these defects they acquired their reputation;
they have a right to our pardon, but not to our admiration.</p>

<p>However, to imitate peculiarities, or mistake defects for
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
beauties, that man will be most liable who confines his
imitation to one favourite master; and even though he
chooses the best, and is capable of distinguishing the real
excellencies of his model, it is not by such narrow practice
that a genius or mastery in the art is acquired. A man is
as little likely to form a true idea of the perfection of the
art by studying a single artist, as he would be to produce a
perfectly beautiful figure, by an exact imitation of any
individual living model. And as the painter, by bringing
together in one piece those beauties which are dispersed
among a great variety of individuals, produces a figure
more beautiful than can be found in nature, so that artist
who can unite in himself the excellencies of the various
great painters, will approach nearer to perfection than any
one of his masters. He who confines himself to the imitation
of an individual, as he never proposes to surpass, so
he is not likely to equal, the object of his imitation.
He professes only to follow; and he that follows must
necessarily be behind.</p>

<p>We should imitate the conduct of the great artists in the
course of their studies, as well as the works which they
produced, when they were perfectly formed. Raffaelle
began by imitating implicitly the manner of Pietro Perugino,
under whom he studied: hence his first works are
scarce to be distinguished from his master's; but soon
forming higher and more extensive views, he imitated the
grand outline of Michel Angelo: he learned the manner of
using colours from the works of Leonardo da Vinci, and
Fratre Bartolomeo: to all this he added the contemplation
of all the remains of antiquity that were within his reach,
and employed others to draw for him what was in Greece
and distant places. And it is from his having taken so
many models, that he became himself a model for all
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
succeeding painters; always imitating, and always
original.</p>

<p>If your ambition, therefore, be to equal Raffaelle, you
must do as Raffaelle did, take many models, and not even
<i>him</i> for your guide alone, to the exclusion of others.
    <a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> And
yet the number is infinite of those who seem, if one may
judge by their style, to have seen no other works but those
of their master, or of some favourite, whose <i>manner</i> is their
first wish, and their last.</p>

<p>I will mention a few that occur to me of this narrow,
confined, illiberal, unscientific, and servile kind of imitators.
Guido was thus meanly copied by Elizabetta, Sirani,
and Simone Cantarini; Poussin, by Verdier and Cheron;
Parmeggiano by Jeronimo Mazzuoli. Paolo Veronese,
and Iacomo Bassan, had for their imitators their brothers
and sons. Pietro da Cortona was followed by Ciro Ferri,
and Romanelli; Rubens, by Jacques Jordaens and Diepenbeke;
Guercino, by his own family, the Gennari. Carlo Maratti
was imitated by Giuseppe Chiari, and Pietro de Pietri; and
Rembrandt, by Bramer, Eeckhout, and Flink. All these,
to whom may be added a much longer list of painters, whose
works among the ignorant pass for those of their masters,
are justly to be censured for barrenness and servility.</p>

<p>To oppose to this list a few that have adopted a more
liberal style of imitation;&mdash;Pellegrino Tibaldi Rosso and
Primaticcio did not coldly imitate, but caught something
of the fire that animates the works of Michel Angelo.
The Caraccis formed their style from Pellegrino Tibaldi,
Correggio, and the Venetian school. Domenichino, Guido,
Lanfranco, Albano, Guercino, Cavidone, Schidone, Tiarini,
though it is sufficiently apparent that they came from the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
school of the Caraccis, have yet the appearance of men who
extended their views beyond the model that lay before
them, and have shown that they had opinions of their own,
and thought for themselves, after they had made themselves
masters of the general principles of their schools.</p>

<p>Le Suer's first manner resembles very much that of his
master Vo&uuml;et; but as he soon excelled him, so he differed
from him in every part of the art. Carlo Maratti succeeded
better than those I have first named, and, I think,
owes his superiority to the extension of his views; beside
his master Andrea Sacchi, he imitated Raffaelle, Guido,
and the Caraccis. It is true, there is nothing very captivating
in Carlo Maratti; but this proceeded from a want
which cannot be completely supplied; that is, want of
strength of parts. In this certainly men are not equal;
and a man can bring home wares only in proportion to the
capital with which he goes to market. Carlo, by diligence,
made the most of what he had; but there was undoubtedly
a heaviness about him, which extended itself, uniformly, to
his invention, expression, his drawing, colouring, and the
general effect of his pictures. The truth is, he never
equalled any of his patterns in any one thing, and he added
little of his own.</p>

<p>But we must not rest contented even in this general
study of the moderns; we must trace back the art to its
fountain-head; to that source from whence they drew their
principal excellencies, the monuments of pure antiquity.
All the inventions and thoughts of the ancients, whether
conveyed to us in statues, bas-reliefs, intaglios, cameos, or
coins, are to be sought after and carefully studied; the
genius that hovers over these venerable relics may be
called the father of modern art.</p>

<p>From the remains of the works of the ancients the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
modern arts were revived, and it is by their means that
they must be restored a second time. However it may
mortify our vanity, we must be forced to allow them our
masters: and we may venture to prophesy, that when they
shall cease to be studied, arts will no longer flourish, and
we shall again relapse into barbarism.</p>

<p>The fire of the artist's own genius operating upon these
materials which have been thus diligently collected, will
enable him to make new combinations, perhaps superior
to what had ever before been in the possession of the art;
as in the mixture of the variety of metals, which are said
to have been melted and run together at the burning of
Corinth, a new and till then unknown metal was produced,
equal in value to any of those that had contributed to its
composition. And though a curious refiner should come
with his crucibles, analyse and separate its various component
parts, yet Corinthian brass would still hold its rank
amongst the most beautiful and valuable of metals.</p>

<p>We have hitherto considered the advantages of imitation
as it tends to form the taste, and as a practice by which a
spark of that genius may be caught which illumines those
noble works that ought always to be present to our
thoughts.</p>

<p>We come now to speak of another kind of imitation; the
borrowing a particular thought, an action, attitude, or
figure, and transplanting it into your own work, this will
either come under the charge of plagiarism, or be warrantable,
and deserve commendation, according to the address
with which it is performed. There is some difference, likewise,
whether it is upon the ancient or moderns that these
depredations are made. It is generally allowed, that no
man need be ashamed of copying the ancients; their works
are considered as a magazine of common property, always
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
open to the public, whence every man has a right to take
what materials he pleases; and if he has the art of using
them, they are supposed to become to all intents and
purposes his own property. The collection of the thoughts
of the ancients which Raffaelle made with so much trouble,
is a proof of his opinion on this subject. Such collections
may be made with much more ease, by means of an art
scarce known in this time; I mean that of engraving; by
which, at an easy rate, every man may now avail himself
of the inventions of antiquity.</p>

<p>It must be acknowledged that the works of the moderns
are more the property of their authors. He who borrows
an idea from an ancient, or even from a modern artist not
his contemporary, and so accommodates it to his own work,
that it makes a part of it, with no seam or joining appearing,
can hardly be charged with plagiarism; poets practise
this kind of borrowing, without reserve. But an artist
should not be contented with this only; he should enter
into a competition with his original, and endeavour to
improve what he is appropriating to his own work. Such
imitation is so far from having anything in it of the
servility of plagiarism, that it is a perpetual exercise of the
mind, a continual invention. Borrowing or stealing with
such art and caution, will have a right to the same lenity
as was used by the Laced&aelig;monians; who did not punish
theft, but the want of artifice to conceal.</p>

<p>In order to encourage you to imitation, to the utmost
extent, let me add, that very finished artists in the inferior
branches of the art will contribute to furnish the mind and
give hints, of which a skilful painter, who is sensible of
what he wants, and is in no danger of being infected by the
contact of vicious models, will know how to avail himself.
He will pick up from dunghills what, by a nice chemistry,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
passing through his own mind, shall be converted into pure
gold; and under the rudeness of Gothic essays, he will find
original, rational, and even sublime inventions.</p>

<p>The works of Albert Durer, Lucas Van Leyden, the
numerous inventions of Tobias Stimmer, and Jost Ammon,
afford a rich mass of genuine materials, which, wrought up,
and polished to elegance, will add copiousness to what, perhaps,
without such aid, could have aspired only to justness
and propriety.</p>

<p>In the luxuriant style of Paul Veronese, in the capricious
compositions of Tintoret, he will find something that will
assist his invention, and give points, from which his own
imagination shall rise and take flight, when the subject
which he treats will with propriety admit of splendid
effects.</p>

<p>In every school, whether Venetian, French, or Dutch,
he will find either ingenious compositions, extraordinary
effects, some peculiar expressions, or some mechanical excellence,
well worthy of his attention, and, in some
measure, of his imitation. Even in the lower class of the
French painters, great beauties are often found, united
with great defects. Though Coypel wanted a simplicity of
taste, and mistook a presumptuous and assuming air for
what is grand and majestic; yet he frequently has good
sense and judgment in his manner of telling his stories,
great skill in his compositions, and is not without a considerable
power of expressing the passions. The modern
affectation of grace in his works, as well as in those of
Bosch and Watteau, may be said to be separated by a
very thin partition from the more simple and pure grace
of Correggio and Parmegiano.</p>

<p>Among the Dutch painters, the correct, firm, and determined
pencil, which was employed by Bamboccio and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
Jean Miel, on vulgar and mean subjects, might, without
any change, be employed on the highest; to which, indeed,
it seems more properly to belong. The greatest style, if
that style is confined to small figures, such as Poussin
generally painted, would receive an additional grace by the
elegance and precision of pencil so admirable in the works
of Teniers; and though the school to which he belonged
more particularly excelled in the mechanism of painting;
yet it produced many, who have shown great abilities in
expressing what must be ranked above mechanical excellencies.
In the works of Frank Hals, the portrait-painter
may observe the composition of a face, the features well put
together, as the painters express it; from whence proceeds
that strong-marked character of individual nature, which is
so remarkable in his portraits, and is not found in an equal
degree in any other painter. If he had joined to this most
difficult part of the art a patience in finishing what he
had so correctly planned, he might justly have claimed the
place which Vandyke, all things considered, so justly holds
as the first of portrait-painters.</p>

<p>Others of the same school have shown great power in
expressing the character and passions of those vulgar people
which were the subjects of their study and attention.
Among those, Jan Steen seems to be one of the most
diligent and accurate observers of what passed in those
scenes which he frequented, and which were to him an
academy. I can easily imagine, that if this extraordinary
man had had the good fortune to have been born in Italy,
instead of Holland; had he lived in Rome, instead of
Leyden; and been blessed with Michel Angelo and
Raffaelle for his masters, instead of Brouwer and Van
Goyen; the same sagacity and penetration which distinguished
so accurately the different characters and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
expression in his vulgar figures, would, when exerted in the
selection and imitation of what was great and elevated in
nature, have been equally successful; and he now would
have ranged with the great pillars and supporters of our
Art.</p>

<p>Men who, although thus bound down by the almost
invincible powers of early habits, have still exerted extraordinary
abilities within their narrow and confined circle;
and have, from the natural vigour of their mind, given
a very interesting expression, and great force and energy
to their works; though they cannot be recommended to be
exactly imitated, may yet invite an artist to endeavour to
transfer, by a kind of parody, their excellencies to his own
performances. Whoever has acquired the power of making
this use of the Flemish, Venetian, and French schools, is a
real genius, and has sources of knowledge open to him
which were wanting to the great artists who lived in the
great age of painting.</p>

<p>To find excellencies, however dispersed; to discover
beauties, however concealed by the multitude of defects
with which they are surrounded, can be the work only
of him, who, having a mind always alive to his art, has
extended his views to all ages and to all schools, and has
acquired from that comprehensive mass which he has thus
gathered to himself&mdash;a well-digested and perfect idea of his
art, to which everything is referred. Like a sovereign judge
and arbiter of art, he is possessed of that presiding power
which separates and attracts every excellence from every
school; selects both from what is great, and what is little;
brings home knowledge from the East and from the West;
making the universe tributary towards furnishing his mind,
and enriching his works with originality and variety of
inventions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
    Thus I have ventured to give my opinion of what
appears to me the true and only method by which an artist
makes himself master of his profession; which I hold
ought to be one continued course of imitation, that is not
to cease but with his life.</p>

<p>Those, who either from their own engagements and
hurry of business, or from indolence, or from conceit and
vanity, have neglected looking out of themselves, as far as
my experience and observation reaches, have from that
time, not only ceased to advance, and improve in their
performances, but have gone backward. They may be
compared to men who have lived upon their principal till
they are reduced to beggary, and left without resources.</p>

<p>I can recommend nothing better, therefore, than that you
endeavour to infuse into your works what you learn from
the contemplation of the works of others. To recommend
this has the appearance of needless and superfluous advice;
but it has fallen within my own knowledge, that artists,
though they were not wanting in a sincere love for their
art, though they had great pleasure in seeing good pictures,
and were well skilled to distinguish what was excellent or
defective in them, yet have gone on in their own manner,
without any endeavour to give a little of those beauties,
which they admired in others, to their own works. It is
difficult to conceive how the present Italian painters, who
live in the midst of the treasures of art, should be contented
with their own style. They proceed in their
commonplace inventions, and never think it worth while
to visit the works of those great artists with which they
are surrounded.</p>

<p>I remember, several years ago, to have conversed at
Rome with an artist of great fame throughout Europe; he
was not without a considerable degree of abilities, but
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
those abilities were by no means equal to his own opinion
of them. From the reputation he had acquired, he too
fondly concluded that he stood in the same rank when
compared with his predecessors, as he held with regard to
his miserable contemporary rivals. In conversation about
some particulars of the works of Raffaelle, he seemed to
have, or to affect to have, a very obscure memory of them.
He told me that he had not set his foot in the Vatican for
fifteen years together; that he had been in treaty to copy
a capital picture of Raffaelle, but that the business had
gone off; however, if the agreement had held, his copy
would have greatly exceeded the original. The merit of this
artist, however great we may suppose it, I am sure would
have been far greater, and his presumption would have
been far less, if he had visited the Vatican, as in reason
he ought to have done, at least once every month of his
life.</p>

<p>I address myself, Gentlemen, to you who have made
some progress in the art, and are to be, for the future,
under the guidance of your own judgment and discretion.
I consider you as arrived to that period when you have
a right to think for yourselves, and to presume that every
man is fallible; to study the masters with a suspicion, that
great men are not always exempt from great faults; to
criticise, compare, and rank their works in your own
estimation, as they approach to, or recede from, that
standard of perfection which you have formed in your
own minds, but which those masters themselves, it must
be remembered, have taught you to make, and which you
will cease to make with correctness, when you cease to
study them. It is their excellencies which have taught
you their defects.</p>

<p>I would wish you to forget where you are, and who it is
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
that speaks to you. I only direct you to higher models and
better advisers. We can teach you here but very little;
you are henceforth to be your own teachers. Do this
justice, however, to the English Academy; to bear in
mind, that in this place you contracted no narrow habits,
no false ideas, nothing that could lead you to the imitation
of any living master, who may be the fashionable darling
of the day. As you have not been taught to flatter us, do
not learn to flatter yourselves. We have endeavoured to
lead you to the admiration of nothing but what is truly
admirable. If you choose inferior patterns, or if you make
your own <i>former</i> works your patterns for your <i>latter</i>, it is
your own fault.</p>

<p>The purport of this discourse, and, indeed, of most of my
other discourses, is, to caution you against that false
opinion, but too prevalent among artists, of the imaginary
powers of native genius, and its sufficiency in great works.
This opinion, according to the temper of mind it meets
with, almost always produces, either a vain confidence,
or a sluggish despair&mdash;both equally fatal to all proficiency.</p>

<p>Study, therefore, the great works of the great masters forever.
Study, as nearly as you can, in the order, in the
manner, and on the principles, on which they studied.
Study nature attentively, but always with those masters in
your company; consider them as models which you are to
imitate, and at the same time as rivals with whom you are
to contend.</p>

<h2>DISCOURSE VII.</h2>

<p class="center"><i>Delivered to the Students of the Royal Academy, on the Distribution of
the Prizes, December 10, 1776.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>THE REALITY OF A STANDARD OF TASTE, AS WELL AS OF CORPORAL
BEAUTY.&mdash;BESIDE THIS IMMEDIATE TRUTH, THERE ARE SECONDARY
TRUTHS, WHICH ARE VARIABLE; BOTH REQUIRING THE
ATTENTION OF THE ARTIST, IN PROPORTION TO THEIR STABILITY
OR THEIR INFLUENCE.</p>
</div>

<p>It has been my uniform endeavour, since I first addressed
you from this place, to impress you strongly with one ruling
idea. I wished you to be persuaded that success in your
art depends almost entirely on your own industry; but the
industry which I principally recommended is not the
industry of the <i>hands</i>, but of the <i>mind</i>.</p>

<p>As our art is not a divine <i>gift</i>, so neither is it a mechanical
<i>trade</i>. Its foundations are laid in solid science; and
practice, though essential to perfection, can never attain
that to which it aims, unless it works under the direction
of principle.</p>

<p>Some writers upon art carry this point too far, and
suppose that such a body of universal and profound learning
is requisite, that the very enumeration of its kinds is
enough to frighten a beginner. Vitruvius, after going
through the many accomplishments of nature, and the
many acquirements of learning, necessary to an architect,
proceeds with great gravity to assert that he ought to be
well skilled in the civil law, that he may not be cheated in
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
the title of the ground he builds on. But without such
exaggeration, we may go so far as to assert, that a painter
stands in need of more knowledge than is to be picked off
his pallet, or collected by looking on his model, whether it
be in life or in picture. He can never be a great artist
who is grossly illiterate.</p>

<p>Every man whose business is description ought to be
tolerably conversant with the poets, in some language or
other; that he may imbibe a poetical spirit, and enlarge
his stock of ideas. He ought to acquire an habit of comparing
and digesting his notions. He ought not to be
wholly unacquainted with that part of philosophy which
gives an insight into human nature, and relates to the
manners, characters, passions, and affections. He ought
to know <i>something</i> concerning the mind, as well as <i>a great
deal</i> concerning the body of man. For this purpose it is
not necessary that he should go into such a compass of
reading as must, by distracting his attention, disqualify
him for the practical part of his profession, and make him
sink the performer in the critic. Reading, if it can be
made the favourite recreation of his leisure hours, will
improve and enlarge his mind, without retarding his
actual industry. What such partial and desultory reading
cannot afford, may be supplied by the conversation of
learned and ingenious men, which is the best of all substitutes
for those who have not the means or opportunities of
deep study. There are many such men in this age; and
they will be pleased with communicating their ideas to
artists, when they see them curious and docile, if they are
treated with that respect and deference which is so justly
their due. Into such society, young artists, if they make
it the point of their ambition, will, by degrees, be admitted.
There, without formal teaching, they will insensibly come
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
to feel and reason like those they live with, and find a
rational and systematic taste imperceptibly formed in their
minds, which they will know how to reduce to a standard
by applying general truth to their own purposes, better,
perhaps, than those to whom they owned the original
sentiment.</p>

<p>Of these studies, and this conversation, the desire and
legitimate offspring, is a power of distinguishing right from
wrong; which power, applied to works of art, is denominated
<span class="smcap">Taste</span>. Let me, then, without further introduction,
enter upon an examination, whether taste be so far beyond
our reach as to be unattainable by care; or be so very
vague and capricious, that no care ought to be employed
about it.</p>

<p>It has been the fate of arts to be enveloped in mysterious
and incomprehensible language, as if it was thought necessary
that even the terms should correspond to the idea
entertained of the instability and uncertainty of the rules
which they expressed.</p>

<p>To speak of genius and taste, as in any way connected
with reason or common-sense, would be, in the opinion of
some towering talkers, to speak like a man who possessed
neither; who had never felt that enthusiasm, or, to use
their own inflated language, was never warmed by that
Promethean fire, which animates the canvas and vivifies
the marble.</p>

<p>If, in order to be intelligible, I appear to degrade art by
bringing her down from the visionary situation in the
clouds, it is only to give her a more solid mansion upon the
earth. It is necessary that at some time or other we should
see things as they really are, and not impose on ourselves
by that false magnitude with which objects appear when
viewed indistinctly as through a mist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
    We will allow a poet to express his meaning, when his
meaning is not well known to himself, with a certain
degree of obscurity, as it is one sort of the sublime. But
when, in plain prose, we gravely talk of courting the Muse
in shady bowers; waiting the call and inspiration of
Genius, finding out where he inhabits, and where he is to
be invoked with the greatest success; of attending to times
and seasons when the imagination shoots with the greatest
vigour, whether at the summer solstice or the vernal
equinox; sagaciously observing how much the wild freedom
and liberty of imagination is cramped by attention to
established rules; and how this same imagination begins to
grow dim in advanced age, smothered and deadened by
too much judgment; when we talk such language, or entertain
such sentiments as these, we generally rest contented
with mere words, or at best entertain notions not only
groundless but pernicious.</p>

<p>If all this means, what it is very possible was originally
intended only to be meant, that in order to cultivate an
art a man secludes himself from the commerce of the
world, and retires into the country at particular seasons:
or that at one time of the year his body is in better health,
and, consequently, his mind fitter for the business of hard
thinking than at another time; or that the mind may be
fatigued and grow confused by long and unremitted application;
this I can understand. I can likewise believe that
a man, eminent when young for possessing poetical imagination,
may, from having taken another road, so neglect its
cultivation as to show less of its powers in his latter life.
But I am persuaded that scarce a poet is to be found,
from Homer down to Dryden, who preserved a sound mind
in a sound body, and continued practising his profession to
the very last, whose latter works are not as replete with
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
the fire of imagination, as those which were produced in
his more youthful days.</p>

<p>To understand literally these metaphors, or ideas expressed
in poetical language, seems to be equally absurd as
to conclude, that because painters sometimes represent
poets writing from the dictates of a little winged boy or
genius, that this same genius did really inform him in a
whisper what he was to write; and that he is himself
but a mere machine, unconscious of the operations of his
own mind.</p>

<p>Opinions generally received and floating in the world,
whether true or false, we naturally adopt and make our
own: they may be considered as a kind of inheritance to
which we succeed and are tenants for life, and which we
leave to our posterity very nearly in the condition in which
we received it, it not being much in any one man's power
either to impair or improve it. The greatest part of these
opinions, like current coin in its circulation, we are used to
take without weighing or examining; but by this inevitable
inattention many adulterated pieces are received, which,
when we seriously estimate our wealth, we must throw
away. So the collector of popular opinions, when he
embodies his knowledge, and forms a system, must separate
those which are true from those which are only plausible.
But it becomes more peculiarly a duty to the professors
of art not to let any opinions relating to <i>that</i> art pass
unexamined. The caution and circumspection required in
such examination we shall presently have an opportunity
of explaining.</p>

<p>Genius and taste, in their common acceptation, appear
to be very nearly related; the difference lies only in this,
that genius has superadded to it a habit or power of execution;
or we may say, that taste, when this power is added,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
changes its name, and is called genius. They both, in the
popular opinion, pretend to an entire exemption from the
restraint of rules. It is supposed that their powers are
intuitive; that under the name of genius great works are
produced, and under the name of taste an exact judgment
is given, without our knowing why, and without our being
under the least obligation to reason, precept, or experience.</p>

<p>One can scarce state these opinions without exposing
their absurdity; yet they are constantly in the mouths of
men, and particularly of artists. They who have thought
seriously on this subject do not carry the point so far; yet
I am persuaded, that even among those few who may be
called thinkers, the prevalent opinion allows less than it
ought to the powers of reason; and considers the principles
of taste, which give all their authority to the rules of art,
as more fluctuating, and as having less solid foundations,
than we shall find, upon examination, they really have.</p>

<p>The common saying, that <i>tastes are not to be disputed</i>,
owes its influence, and its general reception, to the same
error which leads us to imagine this faculty of too high an
original to submit to the authority of an earthly tribunal.
It likewise corresponds with the notions of those who
consider it as a mere phantom of the imagination, so devoid
of substance as to elude all criticism.</p>

<p>We often appear to differ in sentiments from each other,
merely from the inaccuracy of terms, as we are not obliged
to speak always with critical exactness. Something of this
too may arise from want of words in the language in which
we speak to express the more nice discrimination which a
deep investigation discovers. A great deal, however, of
this difference vanishes when each opinion is tolerably explained
and understood by constancy and precision in the
use of terms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
    We apply the term <span class="smcap">Taste</span> to that act of the mind by
which we like or dislike, whatever be the subject. Our
judgment upon an airy nothing, a fancy which has no
foundation, is called by the same name which we give to
our determination concerning those truths which refer to
the most general and most unalterable principles of human
nature; to the works which are only to be produced by the
greatest effort of the human understanding. However
inconvenient this may be, we are obliged to take words as
we find them; all we can do is to distinguish the <span class="smcap">Things</span> to
which they are applied.</p>

<p>We may let pass those things which are at once subjects
of taste and sense, and which, having as much certainty as
the senses themselves, give no occasion to inquiry or dispute.
The natural appetite or taste of the human mind is for
<span class="smcap">Truth</span>; whether that truth results from the real agreement
or equality of original ideas among themselves; from the
agreement of the representation of any object with the thing
represented; or from the correspondence of the several
parts of any arrangement with each other. It is the very
same taste which relishes a demonstration in geometry, that
is pleased with the resemblance of a picture to an original
and touched with the harmony of music.</p>

<p>All these have unalterable and fixed foundations in
nature, and are therefore equally investigated by reason,
and known by study; some with more, some with less
clearness, but all exactly in the same way. A picture that
is unlike is false. Disproportionate ordonnance of parts is
not right; because it cannot be true, until it ceases to be a
contradiction to assert, that the parts have no relation to
the whole. Colouring is true, when it is naturally adapted
to the eye, from brightness, from softness, from harmony,
from resemblance; because these agree with their object,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Nature</span>, and therefore are true; as true as mathematical
demonstration; but known to be true only to those who
study these things.</p>

<p>But besides real, there is also apparent truth, or opinion,
or prejudice. With regard to real truth, when it is known,
the taste which conforms to it is, and must be, uniform.
With regard to the second sort of truth, which may be
called truth upon sufferance, or truth by courtesy, it is
not fixed, but variable. However, whilst these opinions
and prejudices, on which it is founded, continue, they
operate as truth; and the art, whose office it is to please
the mind, as well as instruct it, must direct itself according
to opinion, or it will not attain its end.</p>

<p>In proportion as these prejudices are known to be
generally diffused, or long received, the taste which conforms
to them approaches nearer to certainty, and to a sort of
resemblance to real science, even where opinions are found
to be no better than prejudices. And since they deserve,
on account of their duration and extent, to be considered
as really true, they become capable of no small degree of
stability and determination, by their permanent and uniform
nature.</p>

<p>As these prejudices become more narrow, more local,
more transitory, this secondary taste becomes more and
more fantastical; recedes from real science; is less to be
approved by reason, and less followed by practice: though
in no case perhaps to be wholly neglected, where it does not
stand, as it sometimes does, in direct defiance of the most
respectable opinions received amongst mankind.</p>

<p>Having laid down these positions, I shall proceed with
less method, because less will serve to explain and apply
them.</p>

<p>We will take it for granted, that reason is something
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
invariable, and fixed in the nature of things; and without
endeavouring to go back to an account of first principles,
which for ever will elude our search, we will conclude that
whatever goes under the name of taste, which we can fairly
bring under the dominion of reason, must be considered as
equally exempt from change. If, therefore, in the course
of this inquiry, we can show that there are rules for the
conduct of the artist which are fixed and invariable, it
follows, of course, that the art of the connoisseur, or, in
other words, taste, has likewise invariable principles.</p>

<p>Of the judgment which we make on the works of art,
and the preference that we give to one class of art over
another, if a reason be demanded, the question is perhaps
evaded by answering, I judge from my taste; but it does
not follow that a better answer cannot be given, though,
for common gazers, this may be sufficient. Every man is
not obliged to investigate the cause of his approbation or
dislike.</p>

<p>The arts would lie open for ever to caprice and casualty,
if those who are to judge of their excellencies had no
settled principles by which they are to regulate their
decisions, and the merit or defect of performances were to
be determined by unguided fancy. And indeed we may
venture to assert, that whatever speculative knowledge
is necessary to the artist, is equally and indispensably
necessary to the connoisseur.</p>

<p>The first idea that occurs in the consideration of what is
fixed in art, or in taste, is that presiding principle of
which I have so frequently spoken in former discourses,&mdash;the
general idea of nature. The beginning, the middle,
and the end of everything that is valuable in taste, is comprised
in the knowledge of what is truly nature; for
whatever notions are not conformable to those of nature, or
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
universal opinion, must be considered as more or less
capricious.</p>

<p>My notion of nature comprehends not only the forms
which nature produces, but also the nature and internal
fabric and organisation, as I may call it, of the human
mind and imagination. The terms beauty, or nature,
which are general ideas, are but different modes of expressing
the same thing, whether we apply these terms to
statues, poetry, or pictures. Deformity is not nature, but
an accidental deviation from her accustomed practice. This
general idea, therefore, ought to be called Nature; and
nothing else, correctly speaking, has a right to that name.
But we are sure so far from speaking, in common conversation,
with any such accuracy, that, on the contrary, when
we criticise Rembrandt and other Dutch painters, who
introduced into their historical pictures exact representations
of individual objects with all their imperfections, we
say&mdash;Though it is not in a good taste, yet it is nature.</p>

<p>This misapplication of terms must be very often perplexing
to the young student. Is not art, he may say, an
imitation of nature? Must he not, therefore, who imitates
her with the greatest fidelity be the best artist? By this
mode of reasoning Rembrandt has a higher place than
Raffaelle. But a very little reflection will serve to show
us that these particularities cannot be nature; for how can
that be the nature of man, in which no two individuals are
the same?</p>

<p>It plainly appears, that as a work is conducted under the
influence of general ideas, or partial, it is principally to be
considered as the effect of a good or a bad taste.</p>

<p>As beauty, therefore, does not consist in taking what lies
immediately before you, so neither, in our pursuit of taste,
are those opinions which we first received and adopted the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
best choice, or the most natural to the mind and imagination.
In the infancy of our knowledge we seize with
greediness the good that is within our reach; it is by after-consideration,
and in consequence of discipline, that we
refuse the present for a greater good at a distance. The
nobility or elevation of all arts, like the excellency of virtue
itself, consists in adopting this enlarged and comprehensive
idea; and all criticism built upon the more confined view
of what is natural may properly be called <i>shallow</i> criticism,
rather than false: its defect is, that the truth is not
sufficiently extensive.</p>

<p>It has sometimes happened that some of the greatest
men in our art have been betrayed into errors by this confined
mode of reasoning. Poussin, who upon the whole
may be produced as an artist strictly attentive to the most
enlarged and extensive ideas of nature, from not having
settled principles on this point, has, in one instance at
least, I think, deserted truth for prejudice. He is said to
have vindicated the conduct of Julio Romano for his
inattention to the masses of light and shade, or grouping
the figures in <span class="smcap">The Battle of Constantine</span>, as if designedly
neglected, the better to correspond with the hurry and
confusion of a battle. Poussin's own conduct in many of
his pictures makes us more easily give credit to this report.
That it was too much his own practice, <span class="smcap">The Sacrifice to
Silenus</span>, and <span class="smcap">The Triumph of Bacchus and Ariadne</span>,
may be produced as instances; but this principle is
still more apparent, and may be said to be even more
ostentatiously displayed in his <span class="smcap">Perseus</span> and <span class="smcap">Medusa's
Head</span>.</p>

<p>This is undoubtedly a subject of great bustle and tumult,
and that the first effect of the picture may correspond to
the subject, every principle of composition is violated;
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
there is no principal figure, no principal light, no groups;
everything is dispersed, and in such a state of confusion,
that the eye finds no repose anywhere. In consequence of
the forbidding appearance, I remember turning from it
with disgust, and should not have looked a second time, if
I had not been called back to a closer inspection. I then
indeed found, what we may expect always to find in the
works of Poussin, correct drawing, forcible expression, and
just character; in short, all the excellencies which so much
distinguish the works of this learned painter.</p>

<p>This conduct of Poussin I hold to be entirely improper
to imitate. A picture should please at first sight, and
appear to invite the spectator's attention: if, on the
contrary, the general effect offends the eye, a second view
is not always sought, whatever more substantial and
intrinsic merit it may possess.</p>

<p>Perhaps no apology ought to be received for offences
committed against the vehicle (whether it be the organ of
seeing or of hearing) by which our pleasures are conveyed
to the mind. We must take care that the eye be not perplexed
and distracted by a confusion of equal parts, or
equal lights, or offended by an unharmonious mixture of
colours, as we should guard against offending the ear by
unharmonious sounds. We may venture to be more confident
of the truth of this observation, since we find that
Shakespeare, on a parallel occasion, has made Hamlet
recommend to the players a precept of the same kind&mdash;never
to offend the ear by harsh sounds: <i>In the very
torrent, tempest, and whirlwind of your passion</i>, says he,
<i>you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it
smoothness</i>. And yet, at the same time, he very justly
observes, <i>The end of playing, both at the first, and now, was,
and is, to hold, as 'twere, the mirror up to nature</i>. No one
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
can deny that violent passions will naturally emit harsh
and disagreeable tones; yet this great poet and critic
thought that this imitation of nature would cost too much,
if purchased at the expense of disagreeable sensations, or,
as he expresses it, of <i>splitting the ear</i>. The poet and actor,
as well as the painter of genius, who is well acquainted
with all the variety and sources of pleasure in the mind
and imagination, has little regard or attention to common
nature, or creeping after common-sense. By overleaping
those narrow bounds, he more effectually seizes the whole
mind, and more powerfully accomplishes his purpose. This
success is ignorantly imagined to proceed from inattention
to all rules, and a defiance of reason and judgment;
whereas it is in truth acting according to the best rules and
the justest reason.</p>

<p>He who thinks nature, in the narrow sense of the word,
is alone to be followed, will produce but a scanty entertainment
for the imagination; everything is to be done with
which it is natural for the mind to be pleased, whether
it proceeds from simplicity or variety, uniformity or
irregularity; whether the scenes are familiar or exotic;
rude and wild, or enriched and cultivated; for it is natural
for the mind to be pleased with all these in their turn. In
short, whatever pleases has in it what is analogous to the
mind, and is, therefore, in the highest and best sense of the
word, natural.</p>

<p>It is the sense of nature or truth which ought more
particularly to be cultivated by the professors of art; and
it may be observed, that many wise and learned men, who
have accustomed their minds to admit nothing for truth
but what can be proved by mathematical demonstration,
have seldom any relish for those arts which address themselves
to the fancy, the rectitude and truth of which is
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
known by another kind of proof; and we may add, that
the acquisition of this knowledge requires as much circumspection
and sagacity as is necessary to attain those truths
which are more capable of demonstration. Reason must
ultimately determine our choice on every occasion; but
this reason may still be exerted ineffectually by applying to
taste principles which, though right as far as they go, yet
do not reach the object. No man, for instance, can deny
that it seems at first view very reasonable that a statue,
which is to carry down to posterity the resemblance of an
individual, should be dressed in the fashion of the times, in
the dress which he himself wore: this would certainly be
true, if the dress were part of the man; but after a time,
the dress is only an amusement for an antiquarian; and if
it obstructs the general design of the piece, it is to be disregarded
by the artist. Common-sense must here give way
to a higher sense. In the naked form, and in the disposition
of the drapery, the difference between one artist
and another is principally seen. But if he is compelled to
exhibit the modern dress, the naked form is entirely hid,
and the drapery is already disposed by the skill of the
tailor. Were a Phidias to obey such absurd commands, he
would please no more than an ordinary sculptor; in the
inferior parts of every art the learned and the ignorant are
nearly upon a level.</p>

<p>These were probably among the reasons that induced the
sculptor of that wonderful figure of Laocoon, to exhibit him
naked, notwithstanding he was surprised in the act of
sacrificing to Apollo, and consequently ought to have been
shown in his sacerdotal habits, if those greater reasons had
not preponderated. Art is not yet in so high estimation
with us, as to obtain so great a sacrifice as the ancients
made, especially the Grecians, who suffered themselves to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
be represented naked, whether they were generals, lawgivers,
or kings.</p>

<p>Under this head of balancing and choosing the greater
reason, or of two evils taking the least, we may consider
the conduct of Rubens in the Luxembourg gallery, where
he has mixed allegorical figures with the representations of
real personages, which must be acknowledged to be a fault;
yet, if the artist considered himself as engaged to furnish
this gallery with a rich, various, and splendid ornament,
this could not be done, at least in an equal degree, without
peopling the air and water with these allegorical figures:
he therefore accomplished all that he purposed. In this
case all lesser considerations, which tend to obstruct the
great end of the work, must yield and give way.</p>

<p>The variety which portraits and modern dresses, mixed
with allegorical figures, produce, is not to be slightly given
up upon a punctilio of reason, when that reason deprives
the art in a manner of its very existence. It must always
be remembered that the business of a great painter is to
produce a great picture; he must therefore take especial
care not to be cajoled by specious arguments out of his
materials.</p>

<p>What has been so often said to the disadvantage of
allegorical poetry,&mdash;that it is tedious, and uninteresting,&mdash;cannot
with the same propriety be applied to painting,
where the interest is of a different kind. If allegorical
painting produces a greater variety of ideal beauty, a richer,
a more various and delightful composition, and gives to the
artist a greater opportunity of exhibiting his skill, all the
interest he wishes for is accomplished; such a picture not
only attracts, but fixes the attention.</p>

<p>If it be objected that Rubens judged ill at first in thinking
it necessary to make his work so very ornamental, this
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
puts the question upon new ground. It was his peculiar
style; he could paint in no other; and he was selected for
that work, probably because it was his style. Nobody will
dispute but some of the best of the Roman or Bolognian
schools would have produced a more learned and more noble
work.</p>

<p>This leads us to another important province of taste, that
of weighing the value of the different classes of the art, and
of estimating them accordingly.</p>

<p>All arts have means within them of applying themselves
with success both to the intellectual and sensitive part of
our natures. It cannot be disputed, supposing both these
means put in practice with equal abilities, to which we
ought to give the preference; to him who represents the
heroic arts and more dignified passions of man, or to him
who, by the help of meretricious ornaments, however
elegant and graceful, captivates the sensuality, as it may
be called, of our taste. Thus the Roman and Bolognian
schools are reasonably preferred to the Venetian, Flemish,
or Dutch schools, as they address themselves to our best and
noblest faculties.</p>

<p>Well-turned periods in eloquence, or harmony of numbers
in poetry, which are in those arts what colouring is in
painting, however highly we may esteem them, can never
be considered as of equal importance with the art of unfolding
truths that are useful to mankind, and which make us
better or wiser. Nor can those works which remind us of
the poverty and meanness of our nature be considered as of
equal rank with what excites ideas of grandeur, or raises
and dignifies humanity; or, in the words of a late poet,
which makes the beholder <i>learn to venerate himself as
man</i>.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
    It is reason and good sense, therefore, which ranks and
estimates every art, and every part of that art, according
to its importance, from the painter of animated down to
inanimated nature. We will not allow a man, who shall
prefer the inferior style, to say it is his taste; taste here
has nothing, or at least ought to have nothing, to do with
the question. He wants not taste, but sense and soundness
of judgment.</p>

<p>Indeed, perfection in an inferior style may be reasonably
preferred to mediocrity in the highest walks of art. A
landscape of Claude Lorrain may be preferred to a history
by Luca Giordano; but hence appears the necessity of the
connoisseur's knowing in what consists the excellency of
each class, in order to judge how near it approaches to
perfection.</p>

<p>Even in works of the same kind, as in history-painting,
which is composed of various parts, excellence of an inferior
species, carried to a very high degree, will make a work
very valuable, and in some measure compensate for the
absence of the higher kinds of merit. It is the duty of the
connoisseur to know and esteem, as much as it may deserve,
every part of painting: he will not then think even
Bassano unworthy of his notice; who, though totally
devoid of expression, sense, grace, or elegance, may be
esteemed on account of his admirable taste of colours,
which, in his best works, are little inferior to those of
Titian.</p>

<p>Since I have mentioned Bassano, we must do him likewise
the justice to acknowledge, that though he did not
aspire to the dignity of expressing the characters and
passions of men, yet, with respect to facility and truth in
his manner of touching animals of all kinds, and giving
them what painters call <i>their character</i>, few have excelled him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
    To Bassano we may add Paul Veronese and Tintoret, for
their entire inattention to what is justly thought the most
essential part of our art, the expression of the passions.
Notwithstanding these glaring deficiencies, we justly esteem
their works; but it must be remembered, that they do not
please from those defects, but from their great excellencies
of another kind, and in spite of such transgressions. These
excellencies, too, as far as they go, are founded in the
truth of <i>general</i> nature: they tell the <i>truth</i>, though not
<i>the whole truth</i>.</p>

<p>By these considerations, which can never be too
frequently impressed, may be obviated two errors, which I
observed to have been, formerly at least, the most prevalent,
and to be most injurious to artists; that of thinking
taste and genius to have nothing to do with reason,
and that of taking particular living objects for nature.</p>

<p>I shall now say something on that part of <i>taste</i>, which, as
I have hinted to you before, does not belong so much to
the external form of things, but is addressed to the mind,
and depends on its original frame, or, to use the expression,
the organisation of the soul; I mean the imagination and
the passions. The principles of these are as invariable as
the former, and are to be known and reasoned upon in the
same manner, by an appeal to common-sense deciding upon
the common feelings of mankind. This sense, and these
feelings, appear to me of equal authority, and equally
conclusive. Now this appeal implies a general uniformity
and agreement in the minds of men. It would be else an
idle and vain endeavour to establish rules of art; it would
be pursuing a phantom, to attempt to move affections with
which we were entirely unacquainted. We have no reason
to suspect there is a greater difference between our minds
than between our forms; of which, though there are no two
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
alike, yet there is a general similitude that goes through
the whole race of mankind; and those who have cultivated
their taste can distinguish what is beautiful or deformed,
or, in other words, what agrees with or deviates from the
general idea of nature, in one case, as well as in the other.</p>

<p>The internal fabric of our minds, as well as the external
form of our bodies, being nearly uniform, it seems then to
follow of course, that as the imagination is incapable of
producing any thing originally of itself, and can only vary
and combine those ideas with which it is furnished by
means of the senses, there will be necessarily an agreement
in the imaginations, as in the senses of men. There being
this agreement, it follows, that in all cases, in our lightest
amusements as well as in our most serious actions and
engagements of life, we must regulate our affections of
every kind by that of others. The well-disciplined mind
acknowledges this authority, and submits its own opinion
to the public voice. It is from knowing what are the
general feelings and passions of mankind that we acquire
a true idea of what imagination is; though it appears as if
we had nothing to do but to consult our own particular
sensations, and these were sufficient to ensure us from all
error and mistake.</p>

<p>A knowledge of the disposition and character of the
human mind can be acquired only by experience; a great
deal will be learned, I admit, by a habit of examining what
passes in our bosoms, what are our own motives of action,
and of what kind of sentiments we are conscious on any
occasion. We may suppose an uniformity, and conclude
that the same effect will be produced by the same cause in
the mind of others. This examination will contribute to
suggest to us matters of inquiry; but we can never be sure
that our own sentiments are true and right, till they are
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
confirmed by more extensive observation. One man
opposing another determines nothing; but a general
union of minds, like a general combination of the forces of
all mankind, makes a strength that is irresistible. In fact,
as he who does not know himself, does not know others, so
it may be said with equal truth, that he who does not know
others, knows himself but very imperfectly.</p>

<p>A man who thinks he is guarding himself against
prejudices by resisting the authority of others, leaves open
every avenue to singularity, vanity, self-conceit, obstinacy,
and many other vices, all tending to warp the judgment,
and prevent the natural operation of his faculties. This
submission to others is a deference which we owe, and,
indeed, are forced involuntarily to pay. In fact, we never
are satisfied with our opinions, whatever we may pretend,
till they are ratified and confirmed by the suffrages of the
rest of mankind. We dispute and wrangle for ever; we
endeavour to get men to come to us when we do not go to
them.</p>

<p>He, therefore, who is acquainted with the works which
have pleased different ages and different countries, and has
formed his opinion on them, has more materials, and more
means of knowing what is analogous to the mind of man,
than he who is conversant only with the works of his own
age or country. What has pleased, and continues to please,
is likely to please again: hence are derived the rules of art,
and on this immovable foundation they must ever stand.</p>

<p>This search and study of the history of the mind ought
not to be confined to one art only. It is by the analogy
that one art bears to another that many things are
ascertained, which either were but faintly seen, or, perhaps,
would not have been discovered at all, if the inventor had
not received the first hints from the practices of a sister art
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
on a similar occasion.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The frequent allusions which every
man who treats of any art is obliged to make to others, in
order to illustrate and confirm his principles, sufficiently
show their near connection and inseparable relation.</p>

<p>All arts having the same general end, which is to please;
and addressing themselves to the same faculties, through
the medium of the senses; it follows that their rules and
principles must have as great affinity as the different
materials and the different organs or vehicles by which they
pass to the mind will permit them to retain.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>We may therefore conclude that the real substance, as it
may be called, of what goes under the name of taste, is
fixed and established in the nature of things; that there are
certain and regular causes by which the imagination and
passions of men are affected; and that the knowledge of
these causes is acquired by a laborious and diligent investigation
of nature, and by the same slow progress as wisdom
or knowledge of every kind, however instantaneous its
operations may appear when thus acquired.</p>

<p>It has been often observed, that the good and virtuous
man alone can acquire this true or just relish even of
works of art. This opinion will not appear entirely without
foundation, when we consider that the same habit of
mind, which is acquired by our search after truth, in the
more serious duties of life, is only transferred to the
pursuit of lighter amusements. The same disposition, the
same desire to find something steady, substantial, and
durable, on which the mind can lean, as it were, and rest
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
with safety, actuates us in both cases. The subject only is
changed. We pursue the same method in our search after
the idea of beauty and perfection in each; of virtue, by
looking forward beyond ourselves to society, and to the
whole; of arts, by extending our views in the same manner,
to all ages and all times.</p>

<p>Every art, like our own, has in its composition fluctuating
as well as fixed principles. It is an attentive inquiry
into their difference that will enable us to determine how
far we are influenced by custom and habit, and what is
fixed in the nature of things.</p>

<p>To distinguish how much has solid foundation, we may
have recourse to the same proof by which some hold that
wit ought to be tried; whether it preserves itself when
translated. That wit is false which can subsist only in
one language; and that picture which pleases only one age
or one nation owes its reception to some local or accidental
association of ideas.</p>

<p>We may apply this to every custom and habit of life.
Thus, the general principles of urbanity, politeness, or
civility, have been the same in all nations; but the mode in
which they are dressed is continually varying. The general
idea of showing respect is by making yourself less; but
the manner, whether by bowing the body, kneeling, prostration,
pulling off the upper part of our dress, or taking
away the lower,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> is a matter of custom.</p>

<p>Thus, in regard to ornaments,&mdash;it would be unjust to
conclude, that, because they were at first arbitrarily
contrived, they are therefore undeserving of our attention;
on the contrary, he who neglects the cultivation of those
ornaments acts contrary to nature and reason. As life
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
would be imperfect without its highest ornaments, the
Arts, so these arts themselves would be imperfect without
<i>their</i> ornaments. Though we by no means ought to rank
with these positive and substantial beauties, yet it must
be allowed that a knowledge of both is essentially
requisite towards forming a complete, whole, and perfect
taste. It is in reality from their ornaments that arts
receive their peculiar character and complexion; we may
add, that in them we find the characteristical mark of a
national taste; as, by throwing up a feather in the air, we
know which way the wind blows, better than by a more
heavy matter.</p>

<p>The striking distinction between the works of the Roman,
Bolognian, and Venetian schools consists more in that
general effect which is produced by colours than in the
more profound excellencies of the art; at least it is from
thence that each is distinguished and known at first sight.
Thus it is the ornaments rather than the proportions of
architecture which at the first glance distinguish the
different orders from each other; the Doric is known by
its triglyphs, the Ionic by its volutes, and the Corinthian
by its acanthus.</p>

<p>What distinguishes oratory from a cold narration is a
more liberal, though chaste, use of those ornaments which
go under the name of figurative and metaphorical expressions;
and poetry distinguishes itself from oratory by
words and expressions still more ardent and glowing.
What separates and distinguishes poetry is more particularly
the ornament of <i>verse</i>; it is this which gives it its
character, and is an essential without which it cannot
exist. Custom has appropriated different metre to different
kinds of composition, in which the world is not perfectly
agreed. In England the dispute is not yet settled, which
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
is to be preferred, rhyme or blank verse. But however we
disagree about what these metrical ornaments shall be,
that some metre is essentially necessary is universally
acknowledged.</p>

<p>In poetry or eloquence, to determine how far figurative
or metaphorical language may proceed, and when it begins
to be affectation or beside the truth, must be determined
by taste; though this taste, we must never forget, is regulated
and formed by the presiding feelings of mankind&mdash;by
those works which have approved themselves to all
times and all persons. Thus, though eloquence has undoubtedly
an essential and intrinsic excellence, and immovable
principles common to all languages, founded in
the nature of our passions and affections; yet it has its
ornaments and modes of address, which are merely
arbitrary. What is approved in the eastern nations as
grand and majestic would be considered by the Greeks
and Romans as turgid and inflated; and they, in return,
would be thought by the Orientals to express themselves
in a cold and insipid manner.</p>

<p>We may add, likewise, to the credit of ornaments, that
it is by their means that Art itself accomplishes its purpose.
Fresnoy calls colouring, which is one of the chief ornaments
of painting, <i>lena sororis</i>, that which procures lovers and
admirers to the more valuable excellencies of the art.</p>

<p>It appears to be the same right turn of mind which
enables a man to acquire the <i>truth</i>, or the just idea of
what is right, in the ornaments, as in the more stable
principles of art. It has still the same centre of perfection,
though it is the centre of a smaller circle.</p>

<p>To illustrate this by the fashion of dress, in which there
is allowed to be a good or bad taste. The component parts
of dress are continually changing from great to little, from
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
short to long; but the general form still remains; it is
still the same general dress, which is comparatively fixed,
though on a very slender foundation; but it is on this
which fashion must rest. He who invents with the most
success, or dresses in the best taste, would probably, from
the same sagacity employed to greater purposes, have discovered
equal skill, or have formed the same correct taste,
in the highest labours of art.</p>

<p>I have mentioned taste in dress, which is certainly one
of the lowest subjects to which this word is applied; yet,
as I have before observed, there is a right even here, however
narrow its foundation, respecting the fashion of any
particular nation. But we have still more slender means
of determining to which of the different customs of
different ages or countries we ought to give the preference,
since they seem to be all equally removed from nature. If
an European, when he has cut off his beard, and put false
hair on his head, or bound up his own natural hair in
regular hard knots, as unlike nature as he can possibly
make it; and after having rendered them immovable by
the help of the fat of hogs, has covered the whole with
flour, laid on by a machine with the utmost regularity; if,
when thus attired, he issues forth, and meets a Cherokee
Indian, who has bestowed as much time at his toilet, and
laid on, with equal care and attention, his yellow and red
ochre on particular parts of his forehead or cheeks, as he
judges most becoming; whoever of these two despises the
other for this attention to the fashion of his country, whichever
first feels himself provoked to laugh, is the barbarian.</p>

<p>All these fashions are very innocent; neither worth
disquisition, nor any endeavour to alter them; as the
change would, in all probability, be equally distant from
nature. The only circumstance against which indignation
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
may reasonably be moved, is, where the operation is painful
or destructive of health; such as some of the practices at
Otaheite, and the strait-lacing of the English ladies; of
the last of which practices, how destructive it must be to
health and long life the professor of anatomy took an
opportunity of proving a few days since in this Academy.</p>

<p>It is in dress as in things of greater consequence.
Fashions originate from those only who have the high and
powerful advantages of rank, birth, and fortune. Many of
the ornaments of art, those at least for which no reason can
be given, are transmitted to us, are adopted, and acquire
their consequence from the company in which we have been
used to see them. As Greece and Rome are the fountains
from whence have flowed all kinds of excellence, to that
veneration which they have a right to claim for the pleasure
and knowledge which they have afforded us we voluntarily
add our approbation of every ornament and every custom
that belonged to them, even to the fashion of their dress.
For it may be observed that, not satisfied with them in
their own place, we make no difficulty of dressing statues
of modern heroes or senators in the fashion of the Roman
armour or peaceful robe; we go so far as hardly to bear a
statue in any other drapery.</p>

<p>The figures of the great men of those nations have come
down to us in sculpture. In sculpture remain almost all
the excellent specimens of ancient art. We have so far
associated personal dignity to the persons thus represented,
and the truth of art to their manner of representation, that
it is not in our power any longer to separate them. This
is not so in painting; because, having no excellent ancient
portraits, that connection was never formed. Indeed, we
could no more venture to paint a general officer in a Roman
military habit than we could make a statue in the present
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
uniform. But since we have no ancient portraits, to show
how ready we are to adopt those kind of prejudices, we
make the best authority among the moderns serve the same
purpose. The great variety of excellent portraits with
which Vandyke has enriched this nation, we are not content
to admire for their real excellence, but extend our approbation
even to the dress which happened to be the fashion of
that age. We all very well remember how common it was
a few years ago for portraits to be drawn in this fantastic
dress; and this custom is not yet entirely laid aside. By
this means it must be acknowledged very ordinary pictures
acquired something of the air and effect of the works of
Vandyke, and appeared therefore at first sight to be better
pictures than they really were; they appeared so, however,
to those only who had the means of making this association;
and when made, it was irresistible. But this
association is nature, and refers to that secondary truth
that comes from conformity to general prejudice and
opinion; it is therefore not merely fantastical. Besides
the prejudice which we have in favour of ancient dresses,
there may be likewise other reasons for the effect which
they produce; among which we may justly rank the
simplicity of them, consisting of little more than one single
piece of drapery, without those whimsical capricious forms
by which all other dresses are embarrassed.</p>

<p>Thus, though it is from the prejudice we have in favour
of the ancients, who have taught us architecture, that we
have adopted likewise their ornaments; and though we
are satisfied that neither nature nor reason are the foundation
of those beauties which we imagine we see in that art,
yet if any one, persuaded of this truth, should therefore
invent new orders of equal beauty, which we will suppose
to be possible, they would not please; nor ought he to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
complain, since the old has that great advantage of having
custom and prejudice on its side. In this case we leave
what has every prejudice in its favour, to take that which
will have no advantage over what we have left, but novelty;
which soon destroys itself, and at any rate is but a weak
antagonist against custom.</p>

<p>Ancient ornaments, having the right of possession, ought
not to be removed, unless to make room for that which not
only has higher pretensions, but such pretensions as will
balance the evil and confusion which innovation always
brings with it.</p>

<p>To this we may add, that even the durability of the
materials will often contribute to give a superiority to one
object over another. Ornaments in buildings, with which
taste is principally concerned, are composed of materials
which last longer than those of which dress is composed;
the former, therefore, make higher pretensions to our
favour and prejudice.</p>

<p>Some attention is surely due to what we can no more
get rid of than we can go out of ourselves. We are
creatures of prejudice; we neither can nor ought to eradicate
it; we must only regulate it by reason; which
kind of regulation is indeed little more than obliging the
lesser, the local and temporal prejudices, to give way to
those which are more durable and lasting.</p>

<p>He, therefore, who in his practice of portrait-painting
wishes to dignify his subject, which we will suppose to be a
lady, will not paint her in the modern dress, the familiarity
of which alone is sufficient to destroy all dignity. He
takes care that his work shall correspond to those ideas and
that imagination which he knows will regulate the
judgment of others; and, therefore, dresses his figure something
with the general air of the antique for the sake
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
of dignity, and preserves something of the modern for the
sake of likeness. By this conduct his works correspond
with those prejudices which we have in favour of what we
continually see; and the relish of the antique simplicity
corresponds with what we may call the more learned and
scientific prejudice.</p>

<p>There was a statue made not long since of Voltaire,
which the sculptor, not having that respect for the prejudices
of mankind which he ought to have had, made
entirely naked, and as meagre and emaciated as the original
is said to be. The consequence was what might have been
expected: it remained in the sculptor's shop, though it
was intended as a public ornament and a public honour
to Voltaire, for it was procured at the expense of his
contemporary wits and admirers.</p>

<p>Whoever would reform a nation, supposing a bad taste
to prevail in it, will not accomplish his purpose by going
directly against the stream of their prejudices. Men's
minds must be prepared to receive what is new to them.
Reformation is a work of time. A national taste, however
wrong it may be, cannot be totally changed at once; we
must yield a little to the prepossession which has taken
hold on the mind, and we may then bring people to adopt
what would offend them, if endeavoured to be introduced
by violence. When Battista Franco was employed, in
conjunction with Titian, Paul Veronese, and Tintoret, to
adorn the library of St. Mark, his work, Vasari says, gave
less satisfaction than any of the others: the dry manner of
the Roman school was very ill calculated to please eyes
that had been accustomed to the luxuriancy, splendour, and
richness of Venetian colouring. Had the Romans been the
judges of this work, probably the determination would have
been just contrary; for in the more noble parts of the art
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
Battista Franco was perhaps not inferior to any of his
rivals.</p>

<p>It has been the main scope and principal end of this
discourse to demonstrate the reality of a standard in taste,
as well as in corporeal beauty; that a false or depraved
taste is a thing as well known, as easily discovered, as any
thing that is deformed, misshapen, or wrong in our form
or outward make; and that this knowledge is derived from
the uniformity of sentiments among mankind, from whence
proceeds the knowledge of what are the general habits of
nature; the result of which is an idea of perfect beauty.</p>

<p>If what has been advanced be true&mdash;that beside this
beauty or truth, which is formed on the uniform, eternal,
and immutable laws of nature, and which of necessity can
be but <i>one</i>; that beside this one immutable verity there are
likewise what we have called apparent or secondary truths,
proceeding from local and temporary prejudices, fancies,
fashions, or accidental connection of ideas; if it appears
that these last have still their foundation, however slender,
in the original fabric of our minds; it follows that all these
truths or beauties deserve and require the attention of the
artist, in proportion to their stability or duration, or as
their influence is more or less extensive. And let me add,
that as they ought not to pass their just bounds, so neither
do they, in a well-regulated taste, at all prevent or weaken
the influence of those general principles which alone can
give to art its true and permanent dignity.</p>

<p>To form this just taste is undoubtedly in your own
power, but it is to reason and philosophy that you must
have recourse; from them you must borrow the balance, by
which is to be weighed and estimated the value of every
pretension that intrudes itself on your notice.</p>

<p>The general objection which is made to the introduction
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
of Philosophy into the regions of taste, is, that it checks
and restrains the flights of the imagination, and gives that
timidity, which an over-carefulness not to err or act contrary
to reason is likely to produce. It is not so. Fear
is neither reason nor philosophy. The true spirit of
philosophy, by giving knowledge, gives a manly confidence,
and substitutes rational firmness in the place of vain
presumption. A man of real taste is always a man of
judgment in other respects; and those inventions which
either disdain or shrink from reason are generally, I fear,
more like the dreams of a distempered brain than the
exalted enthusiasm of a sound and true genius. In the
midst of the highest flights of fancy or imagination, reason
ought to preside from first to last, though I admit her more
powerful operation is upon reflection.</p>

<p>Let me add, that some of the greatest names of antiquity,
and those who have most distinguished themselves in works
of genius and imagination, were equally eminent for their
critical skill. Plato, Aristotle, Cicero, and Horace; and
among the moderns, Boileau, Corneille, Pope, and Dryden,
are at least instances of genius not being destroyed by
attention or subjection to rules and science. I should hope,
therefore, that the natural consequence of what has been
said would be, to excite in you a desire of knowing the
principles and conduct of the great masters of our art, and
respect and veneration for them when known.</p>

<h2>DISCOURSE VIII.</h2>

<p class="center"><i>Delivered to the Students of the Royal Academy, on the Distribution
of the Prizes, December 10, 1778.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>THE PRINCIPLES OF ART, WHETHER POETRY OR PAINTING, HAVE
THEIR FOUNDATION IN THE MIND; SUCH AS NOVELTY, VARIETY,
AND CONTRAST; THESE IN THEIR EXCESS BECOME DEFECTS.&mdash;SIMPLICITY,
ITS EXCESS DISAGREEABLE.&mdash;RULES NOT TO BE
ALWAYS OBSERVED IN THEIR LITERAL SENSE: SUFFICIENT TO
PRESERVE THE SPIRIT OF THE LAW.&mdash;OBSERVATIONS ON THE
PRIZE PICTURES.</p>
</div>

<p>I have recommended in former<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> discourses that Artists
should learn their profession by endeavouring to form an
idea of perfection from the different excellencies which lie
dispersed in the various schools of painting. Some difficulty
will still occur, to know what is beauty, and where it
may be found: one would wish not to be obliged to take it
entirely on the credit of fame; though to this, I acknowledge,
the younger students must unavoidably submit. Any
suspicion in them of the chance of their being deceived will
have more tendency to obstruct their advancement than
even an enthusiastic confidence in the perfection of their
models. But to the more advanced in the art, who wish to
stand on more stable and firmer ground, and to establish
principles on a stronger foundation than authority, however
venerable or powerful, it may be safely told that there is still
a higher tribunal, to which those great masters themselves
must submit, and to which, indeed, every excellence in art
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
must be ultimately referred. He who is ambitious to
enlarge the boundaries of his art, must extend his views
beyond the precepts which are found in books or may be
drawn from the practice of his predecessors, to a knowledge
of those precepts in the mind, those operations of intellectual
nature&mdash;to which everything that aspires to please
must be proportioned and accommodated.</p>

<p>Poetry having a more extensive power than our art,
exerts its influence over almost all the passions; among
those may be reckoned one of our most prevalent dispositions&mdash;anxiety
for the future. Poetry operates by
raising our curiosity, engaging the mind by degrees to take
an interest in the event, keeping that event suspended, and
surprising at last with an unexpected catastrophe.</p>

<p>The painter's art is more confined, and has nothing that
corresponds with, or perhaps is equivalent to, this power
and advantage of leading the mind on, till attention is
totally engaged. What is done by Painting must be done
at one blow; curiosity has received at once all the satisfaction
it can ever have. There are, however, other intellectual
qualities and dispositions which the Painter can satisfy and
affect as powerfully as the poet: among those we may
reckon our love of novelty, variety, and contrast; these
qualities, on examination, will be found to refer to a certain
activity and restlessness which has a pleasure and delight
in being exercised and put in motion. Art, therefore, only
administers to those wants and desires of the mind.</p>

<p>It requires no long disquisition to show that the
dispositions which I have stated actually subsist in the
human mind. Variety reanimates the attention, which is
apt to languish under a continual sameness. Novelty
makes a more forcible impression on the mind than can be
made by the representation of what we have often seen
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
before; and contrasts rouse the power of comparison by
opposition. All this is obvious; but, on the other hand, it
must be remembered, that the mind, though an active
principle, has likewise a disposition to indolence; and
though it loves exercise, loves it only to a certain degree,
beyond which it is very unwilling to be led or driven; the
pursuit, therefore, of novelty and variety may be carried to
excess. When variety entirely destroys the pleasure proceeding
from uniformity and repetition, and when novelty
counteracts and shuts out the pleasure arising from old
habits and customs, they oppose too much the indolence of
our disposition; the mind, therefore, can bear with pleasure
but a small portion of novelty at a time. The main part of
the work must be in the mode to which we have been used.
An affection to old habits and customs I take to be the predominant
disposition of the mind, and novelty comes as an
exception; where all is novelty, the attention, the exercise
of the mind is too violent. Contrast, in the same manner,
when it exceeds certain limits, is as disagreeable as a
violent and perpetual opposition; it gives to the senses, in
their progress, a more sudden change than they can bear
with pleasure.</p>

<p>It is then apparent, that those qualities, however they
contribute to the perfection of Art, when kept within
certain bounds, if they are carried to excess, become
defects, and require correction: a work consequently will
not proceed better and better as it is more varied; variety
can never be the groundwork and principle of the
performance&mdash;it must be only employed to recreate and
relieve.</p>

<p>To apply these general observations which belong
equally to all arts, to ours in particular. In a composition,
when the objects are scattered and divided into many equal
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
parts, the eye is perplexed and fatigued, from not knowing
where to find the principal action, or which is the principal
figure; for where all are making equal pretensions to
notice, all are in equal danger of neglect.</p>

<p>The expression which is used very often on these
occasions is, the piece wants repose; a word which perfectly
expresses a relief of the mind from that state of
hurry and anxiety which it suffers when looking at a work
of this character.</p>

<p>On the other hand, absolute unity&mdash;that is, a large work,
consisting of one group or mass of light only&mdash;would be as
defective as an heroic poem without episode, or any collateral
incidents to recreate the mind with that variety
which it always requires.</p>

<p>An instance occurs to me of two painters (Rembrandt
and Poussin), of characters totally opposite to each other in
every respect, but in nothing more than in their mode of
composition, and management of light and shadow. Rembrandt's
manner is absolute unity; he often has but one
group, and exhibits little more than one spot of light in
the midst of a large quantity of shadow: if he has a second
mass, that second bears no proportion to the principal.
Poussin, on the contrary, has scarce any principal mass of
light at all, and his figures are often too much dispersed,
without sufficient attention to place them in groups.</p>

<p>The conduct of these two painters is entirely the reverse
of what might be expected from their general style and
character; the works of Poussin being as much distinguished
for simplicity as those of Rembrandt for combination.
Even this conduct of Poussin might proceed from too great
an affection to simplicity of <i>another kind</i>; too great a
desire to avoid that ostentation of art, with regard to
light and shadow, on which Rembrandt so much wished to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
draw the attention; however, each of them ran into contrary
extremes, and it is difficult to determine which is the
most reprehensible, both being equally distant from the
demands of nature and the purposes of art.</p>

<p>The same just moderation must be observed in regard to
ornaments; nothing will contribute more to destroy repose
than profusion, of whatever kind, whether it consists in
the multiplicity of objects, or the variety and brightness of
colours. On the other hand, a work without ornament,
instead of simplicity, to which it makes pretensions, has
rather the appearance of poverty. The degree to which
ornaments are admissible must be regulated by the professed
style of the work; but we may be sure of this truth,&mdash;that
the most ornamental style requires repose to set off
even its ornaments to advantage. I cannot avoid mentioning
here an instance of repose, in that faithful and accurate
painter of nature, Shakespeare&mdash;the short dialogue between
Duncan and Banquo, whilst they are approaching the gates
of Macbeth's castle. Their conversation very naturally
turns upon the beauty of its situation, and the pleasantness
of the air; and Banquo, observing the martlets' nests in
every recess of the cornice, remarks, that where those birds
most breed and haunt the air is delicate. The subject of
this quiet and easy conversation gives that repose so necessary
to the mind, after the tumultuous bustle of the preceding
scenes, and perfectly contrasts the scene of horror
that immediately succeeds. It seems as if Shakespeare
asked himself, What is a prince likely to say to his attendants
on such an occasion? The modern writers seem, on
the contrary, to be always searching for new thoughts, such
as never could occur to man in the situation represented.
This is also frequently the practice of Homer, who from
the midst of battles and horrors relieves and refreshes the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
mind of the reader, by introducing some quiet rural image,
or picture of familiar domestic life. The writers of every
age and country, where taste has begun to decline, paint
and adorn every object they touch; are always on the
stretch; never deviate or sink a moment from the pompous
and the brilliant. Lucan, Statius, and Claudian (as a
learned critic has observed) are examples of this bad taste
and want of judgment; they never soften their tones, or
condescend to be natural; all is exaggeration and perpetual
splendour, without affording repose of any kind.</p>

<p>As we are speaking of excesses, it will not be remote
from our purpose to say a few words upon simplicity;
which, in one of the senses in which it is used, is considered
as the general corrector of excess. We shall at present
forbear to consider it as implying that exact conduct
which proceeds from an intimate knowledge of simple
unadulterated nature, as it is then only another word for
perfection, which neither stops short of, nor oversteps
reality and truth.</p>

<p>In our inquiry after simplicity, as in many other inquiries
of this nature, we can best explain what is right by showing
what is wrong; and, indeed, in this case it seems to be
absolutely necessary; simplicity being only a negative
virtue, cannot be described or defined. We must therefore
explain its nature, and show the advantage and beauty
which is derived from it, by showing the deformity which
proceeds from its neglect.</p>

<p>Though instances of this neglect might be expected to be
found in practice, we should not expect to find in the works
of critics precepts that bid defiance to simplicity and everything
that relates to it. De Piles recommends to us
portrait-painters, to add grace and dignity to the characters
of those whose pictures we draw: so far he is undoubtedly
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
right; but, unluckily, he descends to particulars, and gives
his own idea of grace and dignity. "<i>If</i>," says he, "<i>you
draw persons of high character and dignity, they ought to
be drawn in such an attitude that the Portraits must seem
to speak to us of themselves, and, as it were, to say to us,
'Stop, take notice of me, I am that invincible King,
surrounded by Majesty:' 'I am that valiant commander,
who struck terror everywhere:' 'I am that great minister,
who knew all the springs of politics:' 'I am that magistrate
of consummate wisdom and probity.'</i>" He goes on in this
manner with all the characters he can think on. We may
contrast the tumour of this presumptuous loftiness with
the natural, unaffected air of the portraits of Titian, where
dignity, seeming to be natural and inherent, draws
spontaneous reverence, and instead of being thus vainly
assumed, has the appearance of an unalienable adjunct;
whereas such pompous and laboured insolence of grandeur
is so far from creating respect, that it betrays vulgarity and
meanness, and new-acquired consequence.</p>

<p>The painters, many of them at least, have not been
backward in adopting the notions contained in these
precepts. The portraits of Rigaud are perfect examples of
an implicit observance of these rules of De Piles; so that
though he was a painter of great merit in many respects,
yet that merit is entirely overpowered by a total absence of
simplicity in every sense.</p>

<p>Not to multiply instances, which might be produced for
this purpose, from the works of history-painters, I shall
mention only one,&mdash;a picture which I have seen, of the
Supreme Being, by Coypell.</p>

<p>This subject the Roman Catholic painters have taken the
liberty to represent, however indecent the attempt, and
however obvious the impossibility of any approach to an
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
adequate representation; but here the air and character
which the Painter has given, and he has doubtless given
the highest he could conceive, are so degraded by an
attempt at such dignity as De Piles has recommended,
that we are enraged at the folly and presumption of the
artist, and consider it as little less than profanation.</p>

<p>As we have passed to a neighbouring nation for instances
of want of this quality, we must acknowledge at the same
time that they have produced great examples of simplicity,
in Poussin and Le Sueur. But as we are speaking of the
most refined and subtle notion of perfection, may we not
inquire, whether a curious eye cannot discern some faults,
even in those great men? I can fancy that even Poussin,
by abhorring that affectation and that want of simplicity
which he observed in his countrymen, has, in certain
particulars, fallen into the contrary extreme, so far as to
approach to a kind of affectation:&mdash;to what, in writing,
would be called pedantry.</p>

<p>When simplicity, instead of being a corrector, seems to
set up for herself; that is, when an artist seems to value
himself solely upon this quality; such an ostentatious
display of simplicity becomes then as disagreeable and
nauseous as any other kind of affectation. He is, however,
in this case likely enough to sit down contented with his
own work, for though he finds the world look at it with
indifference or dislike, as being destitute of every quality that
can recreate or give pleasure to the mind, yet he consoles
himself that it has simplicity, a beauty of too pure and
chaste a nature to be relished by vulgar minds.</p>

<p>It is in art as in morals; no character would inspire us with
an enthusiastic admiration of his virtue, if that virtue consisted
only in an absence of vice; something more is required;
a man must do more than merely his duty to be a hero.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
    Those works of the ancients, which are in the highest
esteem, have something beside mere simplicity to recommend
them. The Apollo, the Venus, the Laocoon, the Gladiator,
have a certain composition of action, have contrasts sufficient
to give grace and energy in a high degree; but it
must be confessed of the many thousand antique statues
which we have, that their general characteristic is bordering
at least on inanimate insipidity.</p>

<p>Simplicity, when so very inartificial as to seem to evade
the difficulties of art, is a very suspicious virtue.</p>

<p>I do not, however, wish to degrade simplicity from the
high estimation in which it has been ever justly held. It
is our barrier against that great enemy to truth and
nature, Affectation, which is ever clinging to the pencil, and
ready to drop in and poison everything it touches.</p>

<p>Our love and affection to simplicity proceeds in a great
measure from our aversion to every kind of affectation.
There is likewise another reason why so much stress is laid
upon this virtue; the propensity which artists have to fall
into the contrary extreme: we therefore set a guard on that
side which is most assailable. When a young artist is first
told that his composition and his attitudes must be
contrasted, that he must turn the head contrary to the
position of the body, in order to produce grace and animation;
that his outline must be undulating, and swelling, to
give grandeur; and that the eye must be gratified with a
variety of colours; when he is told this, with certain
animating words of Spirit, Dignity, Energy, Grace, greatness
of Style, and brilliancy of Tints, he becomes suddenly
vain of his newly-acquired knowledge, and never thinks he
can carry those rules too far. It is then that the aid of
simplicity ought to be called in to correct the exuberance
of youthful ardour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
    The same may be said in regard to colouring, which in
its pre-eminence is particularly applied to flesh. An artist,
in his first essay of imitating nature, would make the whole
mass of one colour, as the oldest painters did; till he is
taught to observe not only the variety of tints, which are
in the object itself, but the differences produced by the
gradual decline of light to shadow; he then immediately
puts his instruction in practice, and introduces a variety of
distinct colours. He must then be again corrected and
told, that though there is this variety, yet the effect of the
whole upon the eye must have the union and simplicity of
the colouring of nature.</p>

<p>And here we may observe that the progress of an
individual Student bears a great resemblance to the
progress and advancement of the Art itself. Want of
simplicity would probably be not one of the defects of an
artist who had studied nature only, as it was not of the old
masters, who lived in the time preceding the great Art of
Painting; on the contrary, their works are too simple and
too inartificial.</p>

<p>The Art in its infancy, like the first work of a Student,
was dry, hard, and simple. But this kind of barbarous
simplicity would be better named Penury, as it proceeds
from mere want&mdash;from want of knowledge, want of resources,
want of abilities to be otherwise; their simplicity
was the offspring, not of choice, but necessity.</p>

<p>In the second stage they were sensible of this poverty;
and those who were the most sensible of the want were the
best judges of the measure of the supply. There were
painters who emerged from poverty without falling into
luxury. Their success induced others, who probably never
would of themselves have had strength of mind to discover
the original defect, to endeavour at the remedy by an
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
abuse; and they ran into the contrary extreme. But
however they may have strayed, we cannot recommend to
them to return to that simplicity which they have justly
quitted; but to deal out their abundance with a more
sparing hand, with that dignity which makes no parade,
either of its riches or of its art. It is not easy to give a
rule which may serve to fix this just and correct medium;
because, when we may have fixed, or nearly fixed, the middle
point, taken as a general principle, circumstances may
oblige us to depart from it, either on the side of Simplicity,
or on that of Variety and Decoration.</p>

<p>I thought it necessary in a former discourse, speaking of
the difference of the sublime and ornamental style of
painting&mdash;in order to excite your attention to the more
manly, noble, and dignified manner&mdash;to leave perhaps an
impression too contemptuous of those ornamental parts of
our Art, for which many have valued themselves, and many
works are much valued and esteemed.</p>

<p>I said then what I thought it was right at that time to
say; I supposed the disposition of young men more
inclinable to splendid negligence than perseverance in
laborious application to acquire correctness: and therefore
did as we do in making what is crooked straight, by bending it
the contrary way, in order that it may remain straight at last.</p>

<p>For this purpose, then, and to correct excess or neglect
of any kind, we may here add, that it is not enough that a
work be learned; it must be pleasing; the painter must
add grace to strength, if he desires to secure the first impression
in his favour. Our taste has a kind of sensuality
about it, as well as a love of the sublime; both these
qualities of the mind are to have their proper consequence,
as far as they do not counteract each other; for that is the
grand error which much care ought to be taken to avoid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
    There are some rules, whose absolute authority, like that
of our nurses, continues no longer than while we are in a
state of childhood. One of the first rules, for instance, that
I believe every master would give to a young pupil,
respecting his conduct and management of light and
shadow, would be what Lionardo da Vinci has actually
given; that you must oppose a light ground to the
shadowed side of your figure, and a dark ground to the
light side. If Lionardo had lived to see the superior
splendour and effect which has been since produced by the
exactly contrary conduct&mdash;by joining light to light and
shadow to shadow&mdash;though without doubt he would have
admired it, yet, as it ought not, so probably it would not
be the first rule with which he would have begun his
instructions.</p>

<p>Again; in the artificial management of the figures, it is
directed that they shall contrast each other according to
the rules generally given; that if one figure opposes his
front to the spectator, the next figure is to have his back
turned, and that the limbs of each individual figure be
contrasted; that is, if the right leg be put forward, the
right arm is to be drawn back.</p>

<p>It is very proper that those rules should be given in the
Academy; it is proper the young students should be
informed that some research is to be made, and that they
should be habituated to consider every excellence as
reducible to principles. Besides, it is the natural progress
of instruction to teach first what is obvious and perceptible
to the senses, and from hence proceed gradually to notions
large, liberal, and complete, such as comprise the more
refined and higher excellencies in Art. But when students
are more advanced, they will find that the greatest beauties
of character and expression are produced without contrast;
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
nay more, that this contrast would ruin and destroy that
natural energy of men engaged in real action, unsolicitous
of grace. St. Paul preaching at Athens, in one of the
Cartoons, far from any affected academical contrast of
limbs, stands equally on both legs, and both hands are in
the same attitude: add contrast, and the whole energy and
unaffected grace of the figure is destroyed. Elymas the
sorcerer stretches both hands forward in the same direction,
which gives perfectly the expression intended. Indeed, you
never will find in the works of Raffaelle any of those
school-boy affected contrasts. Whatever contrast there is,
appears without any seeming agency of art, by the natural
chance of things.</p>

<p>What has been said of the evil of excesses of all kinds,
whether of simplicity, variety, or contrast, naturally
suggests to the painter the necessity of a general inquiry
into the true meaning and cause of rules, and how they
operate on those faculties to which they are addressed: by
knowing their general purpose and meaning he will often
find that he need not confine himself to the literal sense;
it will be sufficient if he preserve the spirit of the law.</p>

<p>Critical remarks are not always understood without
examples: it may not be improper, therefore, to give
instances where the rule itself, though generally received, is
false, or where a narrow conception of it may lead the
artists into great errors.</p>

<p>It is given as a rule by Fresnoy, That <i>the principal
figure of a subject must appear in the midst of the picture,
under the principal light, to distinguish it from the rest</i>.
A painter who should think himself obliged secretly to
follow this rule, would encumber himself with needless
difficulties; he would be confined to great uniformity of
composition, and be deprived of many beauties which are
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
incompatible with its observance. The meaning of this
rule extends, or ought to extend, no further than this:&mdash;That
the principal figure should be immediately distinguished
at the first glance of the eye; but there is no
necessity that the principal light should fall on the
principal figure, or that the principal figure should be in
the middle of the picture. It is sufficient that it be distinguished
by its place, or by the attention of other figures
pointing it out to the spectator. So far is this rule from
being indispensable, that it is very seldom practised; other
considerations of greater consequence often standing in the
way. Examples in opposition to this rule are found in the
Cartoons, in Christ's Charge to Peter, the Preaching of St.
Paul, and Elymas the Sorcerer, who is undoubtedly the
principal object in that picture. In none of those compositions
is the principal figure in the midst of the picture.
In the very admirable composition of the Tent of Darius,
by Le Brun, Alexander is not in the middle of the picture,
nor does the principal light fall on him; but the attention of
all the other figures immediately distinguishes him, and distinguishes
him more properly; the greatest light falls on the
daughter of Darius, who is in the middle of the picture, where
it is more necessary the principal light should be placed.</p>

<p>It is very extraordinary that Felibien, who has given a
very minute description of this picture, but indeed such a
description as may be called rather panegyric than
criticism, thinking it necessary (according to the precept
of Fresnoy) that Alexander should possess the principal
light, has accordingly given it to him; he might with equal
truth have said that he was placed in the middle of the
picture, as he seemed resolved to give this piece every kind
of excellence which he conceived to be necessary to perfection.
His generosity is here unluckily misapplied, as it
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
would have destroyed, in a great measure, the beauty of the
composition.</p>

<p>Another instance occurs to me, where equal liberty may
be taken, in regard to the management of light. Though
the general practice is, to make a large mass about the
middle of the picture surrounded by shadow, the reverse
may be practised, and the spirit of the rule may still be
preserved. Examples of this principle reversed may be
found very frequently in the works of the Venetian School.
In the great composition of Paul Veronese, <span class="smcap">The Marriage
at Cana</span>, the figures are, for the most part, in half shadow;
the great light is in the sky; and, indeed, the general effect
of this picture, which is so striking, is no more than what
we often see in landscapes, in small pictures of fairs and
country feasts; but those principles of light and shadow,
being transferred to a large scale, to a space containing
near a hundred figures as large as life, and conducted to all
appearance with as much facility, and with an attention as
steadily fixed upon <i>the whole together</i>, as if it were a small
picture immediately under the eye, the work justly excites
our admiration; the difficulty being increased as the extent
is enlarged.</p>

<p>The various modes of composition are infinite; sometimes
it shall consist of one large group in the middle of
the picture, and the smaller groups on each side; or a
plain space in the middle, and the groups of figures ranked
round this vacuity.</p>

<p>Whether this principal broad light be in the middle
space of ground, as in <span class="smcap">The School of Athens</span>; or in the
sky, as in <span class="smcap">The Marriage at Cana</span>, in
    <span class="smcap">The Andromeda</span>,
and in most of the pictures of Paul Veronese; or whether
the light be on the groups; whatever mode of composition
is adopted, every variety and license is allowable: this
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
only is indisputably necessary, that to prevent the eye
from being distracted and confused by a multiplicity of
objects of equal magnitude, those objects, whether they
consist of lights, shadows, or figures, must be disposed in
large masses and groups properly varied and contrasted;
that to a certain quantity of action a proportioned space of
plain ground is required; that light is to be supported by
sufficient shadow; and we may add, that a certain quantity
of cold colours is necessary to give value and lustre to the
warm colours: what those proportions are cannot be so
well learnt by precept as by observation on pictures, and in
this knowledge bad pictures will instruct as well as good.
Our inquiry why pictures have a bad effect may be as
advantageous as the inquiry why they have a good effect;
each will corroborate the principles that are suggested by
the other.</p>

<p>Though it is not my <i>business</i> to enter into the detail of
our Art, yet I must take this opportunity of mentioning
one of the means of producing that great effect which we
observe in the works of the Venetian painters, as I think
it is not generally known or observed. It ought, in my
opinion, to be indispensably observed, that the masses of
light in a picture be always of a warm mellow colour,
yellow, red, or a yellowish-white; and that the blue, the
grey, or the green colours be kept almost entirely out of
these masses, and be used only to support and set off these
warm colours; and for this purpose, a small portion of cold
colours will be sufficient.</p>

<p>Let this conduct be reserved; let the light be cold, and
the surrounding colours warm, as we often see in the works
of the Roman and Florentine painters, and it will be out of
the power of art, even in the hands of Rubens or Titian, to
make a picture splendid and harmonious.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
    Le Brun and Carlo Maratti were two painters of great
merit, and particularly what may be called Academical
Merit, but were both deficient in this management of
colours; the want of observing this rule is one of the
causes of that heaviness of effect which is so observable in
their works. The principal light in the Picture of Le
Brun, which I just now mentioned, falls on Statira, who is
dressed very injudiciously in a pale blue drapery: it is
true, he has heightened this blue with gold, but that is not
enough; the whole picture has a heavy air, and by no
means answers the expectations raised by the print.
Poussin often made a spot of blue drapery, when the
general hue of the picture was inclinable to brown or
yellow; which shows sufficiently that harmony of colouring
was not a part of the art that had much engaged the
attention of that great painter.</p>

<p>The conduct of Titian in the picture of <span class="smcap">Bacchus and
Ariadne</span> has been much celebrated, and justly, for the
harmony of colouring. To Ariadne is given (say the
critics) a red scarf, to relieve the figure from the sea,
which is behind her. It is not for that reason alone, but
for another of much greater consequence; for the sake of
the general harmony and effect of the picture. The figure of
Ariadne is separated from the great group, and is dressed
in blue, which, added to the colour of the sea, makes that
quantity of cold colour which Titian thought necessary for
the support and brilliancy of the great group; which group
is composed, with very little exception, entirely of mellow
colours. But as the picture in this case would be divided
into two distinct parts, one half cold, and the other warm,
it was necessary to carry some of the mellow colours of the
great group into the cold part of the picture, and a part of
the cold into the great group; accordingly, Titian gave
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
Ariadne a red scarf, and to one of the Bacchante a little
blue drapery.</p>

<p>The light of the picture, as I observed, ought to be of a
warm colour; for though white may be used for the
principal light, as was the practice of many of the Dutch
and Flemish painters, yet it is better to suppose <i>that white</i>
illumined by the yellow rays of the setting sun, as was
the manner of Titian. The superiority of which manner is
never more striking than when in a collection of pictures
we chance to see a portrait of Titian's hanging by the side
of a Flemish picture (even though that should be of the
hand of Vandyke), which, however admirable in other
respects, becomes cold and grey in the comparison.</p>

<p>The illuminated parts of objects are in nature of a
warmer tint than those that are in the shade; what I have
recommended, therefore, is no more than that the same
conduct be observed in the whole, which is acknowledged
to be necessary in every individual part. It is presenting
to the eye the same effect as that which it has been
<i>accustomed</i> to feel, which, in this case, as in every other,
will always produce beauty; no principle, therefore, in
our art can be more certain, or is derived from a higher
source.</p>

<p>When I just now mentioned of the supposed reason
why Ariadne has part of her drapery red, gives me occasion
here to observe, that this favourite quality of giving objects
relief, and which De Piles and all the Critics have considered
as a requisite of the utmost importance, was not
one of those objects which much engaged the attention of
Titian; painters of an inferior rank have far exceeded him
in producing this effect. This was a great object of attention,
when art was in its infant state; as it is at present
with the vulgar and ignorant, who feel the highest
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
satisfaction in seeing a figure, which, as they say, looks as
if they could walk round it. But however low I may rate
this pleasure of deception, I should not oppose it, did it
not oppose itself to a quality of a much higher kind, by
counteracting entirely that fulness of manner which is so
difficult to express in words, but which is found in
perfection in the best works of Correggio, and we may
add, of Rembrandt. This effect is produced by melting
and losing the shadows in a ground still darker than those
shadows; whereas that relief is produced by opposing and
separating the ground from the figure, either by light, or
shadow, or colour. This conduct of in-laying, as it may be
called, figures on their ground, in order to produce relief, was
the practice of the old Painters, such as Andrea Mantegna,
Pietro Perugino, and Albert Durer; and to these we may
add the first manner of Lionardo da Vinci, Giorgione, and
even Correggio; but these three were among the first who
began to correct themselves in dryness of style, by no
longer considering relief as a principal object. As those
two qualities, relief, and fulness of effect, can hardly exist
together, it is not very difficult to determine to which we
ought to give the preference. An artist is obliged forever
to hold a balance in his hand, by which he must
determine the value of different qualities; that, when
<i>some</i> fault must be committed, he may choose the least.
Those painters who have best understood the art of
producing a good effect have adopted one principle that
seems perfectly conformable to reason; that a part may
be sacrificed for the good of the whole. Thus, whether
the masses consist of light or shadow, it is necessary
that they should be compact and of a pleasing shape: to
this end some parts may be made darker and some
lighter, and reflections stronger than nature would warrant.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
Paul Veronese took great liberties of this kind. It is
said, that being once asked why certain figures were
painted in shade, as no cause was seen in the picture
itself, he turned off the inquiry by answering, "<i>Una nuevola
che passa</i>"&mdash;a cloud is passing, which has overshadowed
them.</p>

<p>But I cannot give a better instance of this practice than
a picture which I have of Rubens; it is a representation
of a Moonlight. Rubens has not only diffused more light
over the picture than is in nature, but has bestowed on it
those warm glowing colours by which his works are so much
distinguished. It is so unlike what any other painters
have given us of Moonlight, that it might be easily
mistaken, if he had not likewise added stars, for a fainter
setting sun. Rubens thought the eye ought to be satisfied
in this case, above all other considerations; he might,
indeed, have made it more natural, but it would have been
at the expense of what he thought of much greater consequence&mdash;the
harmony proceeding from the contrast and
variety of colours.</p>

<p>This same picture will furnish us with another instance,
where we must depart from nature for a greater advantage.
The Moon in this picture does not preserve so great a
superiority in regard to its lightness over the subject
which it illumines as it does in nature; this is likewise an
intended deviation, and for the same reason. If Rubens
had preserved the same scale of gradation of light between
the Moon and the objects which is found in nature, the
picture must have consisted of one small spot of light only,
and at a little distance from the picture nothing but this
spot would have been seen. It may be said, indeed, that
this being the case, it is a subject that ought not to be
painted; but then, for the same reason, neither armour,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
nor anything shining, ought ever to be painted; for though
pure white is used in order to represent the greatest light
of shining objects, it will not in the picture preserve the
same superiority over flesh as it has in nature, without
keeping that flesh colour of a very low tint. Rembrandt,
who thought it of more consequence to paint light than the
objects that are seen by it, has done this in a picture of
Achilles which I have. The head is kept down to a very
low tint, in order to preserve this due gradation and
distinction between the armour and the face; the consequence
of which is, that, upon the whole, the picture is
too black. Surely too much is sacrificed here to this
narrow conception of nature; allowing the contrary conduct
a fault, yet it must be acknowledged a less fault than
making a picture so dark that it cannot be seen without a
peculiar light, and then with difficulty. The merit or
demerit of the different conduct of Rubens and Rembrandt
in those instances which I have given, is not to be determined
by the narrow principles of nature, separated from
its effect on the human mind. Reason and common-sense
tell us, that before, and above all other considerations, it is
necessary that the work should be seen, not only without
difficulty or inconvenience, but with pleasure and satisfaction;
and every obstacle which stands in the way of this
pleasure and convenience must be removed.</p>

<p>The tendency of this Discourse, with the instances which
have been given, is not so much to place the Artist above
rules, as to teach him their reason; to prevent him from
entertaining a narrow, confined conception of Art; to clear
his mind from a perplexed variety of rules and their
exceptions, by directing his attention to an intimate
acquaintance with the passions and affections of the mind,
from which all rules arise, and to which they are all
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
referable. Art effects its purpose by their means; an
accurate knowledge, therefore, of those passions and dispositions
of the mind is necessary to him who desires to
affect them upon sure and solid principles.</p>

<p>A complete essay or inquiry into the connection between
the rules of Art and the eternal and immutable dispositions
of our passions would be indeed going at once to the
foundation of criticism;<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> but I am too well convinced what
extensive knowledge, what subtle and penetrating judgment,
would be required to engage in such an undertaking; it is
enough for me if, in the language of painters, I have produced
a slight sketch of a part of this vast composition, but
that sufficiently distinct to show the usefulness of such a
theory, and its practicability.</p>

<p>Before I conclude, I cannot avoid making one observation
on the pictures now before us. I have observed, that
every candidate has copied the celebrated invention of
Timanthes in hiding the face of Agamemnon in his mantle;
indeed, such lavish encomiums have been bestowed on this
thought, and that too by men of the highest character in
critical knowledge&mdash;Cicero, Quintilian, Valerius, Maximus,
and Pliny&mdash;and have been since re-echoed by almost every
modern that has written on the Arts, that your adopting it
can neither be wondered at nor blamed. It appears now
to be so much connected with the subject, that the spectator
would perhaps be disappointed in not finding united in the
picture what he always united in his mind, and considered
as indispensably belonging to the subject. But it may be
observed, that those who praise this circumstance were not
painters. They use it as an illustration only of their own
art; it served their purpose, and it was certainly not their
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
business to enter into the objections that lie against it in
another Art. I fear <i>we</i> have but very scanty means of
exciting those powers over the imagination which make so
very considerable and refined a part of poetry. It is a
doubt with me, whether we should even make the attempt.
The chief, if not the only occasion, which the painter has
for this artifice, is, when the subject is improper, to be more
fully represented, either for the sake of decency, or to avoid
what would be disagreeable to be seen; and this is not to
raise or increase the passions, which is the reason that is
given for this practice, but, on the contrary, to diminish
their effect.</p>

<p>It is true, sketches, or such drawings as painters
generally make for their works, give this pleasure of
imagination to a high degree. From a slight, undetermined
drawing, where the ideas of the composition and character
are, as I may say, only just touched upon, the imagination
supplies more than the painter himself, probably, could
produce; and we accordingly often find that the finished
work disappoints the expectation that was raised from the
sketch; and this power of the imagination is one of the
causes of the great pleasure we have in viewing a collection
of drawings by great painters. These general ideas,
which are expressed in sketches, correspond very well to the
art often used in Poetry. A great part of the beauty of
the celebrated description of Eve in Milton's "Paradise
Lost" consists in using only general indistinct expressions,
every reader making out the detail according to his own
particular imagination,&mdash;his own idea of beauty, grace,
expression, dignity, or loveliness: but a painter, when he
represents Eve on a canvas, is obliged to give a determined
form, and his own idea of beauty distinctly expressed.</p>

<p>We cannot on this occasion, nor indeed on any other,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
recommend an undeterminate manner or vague ideas of
any kind, in a complete and finished picture. This notion,
therefore, of leaving anything to the imagination, opposes a
very fixed and indispensable rule in our art&mdash;that everything
shall be carefully and distinctly expressed, as if the
painter knew, with correctness and precision, the exact
form and character of whatever is introduced into the
picture. This is what with us is called Science and
Learning: which must not be sacrificed and given up for
an uncertain and doubtful beauty, which, not naturally
belonging to our Art, will probably be sought for without
success.</p>

<p>Mr. Falconet has observed, in a note on this passage in
his translation of Pliny, that the circumstance of covering
the face of Agamemnon was probably not in consequence
of any fine imagination of the painter&mdash;which he considers
as a discovery of the critics&mdash;but merely copied from the
description of the sacrifice, as it is found in Euripides.</p>

<p>The words from which the picture is supposed to be
taken are these: <i>Agamemnon saw Iphigenia advance
towards the fatal altar; he groaned, he turned aside his
head, he shed tears, and covered his face with his robe.</i></p>

<p>Falconet does not at all acquiesce in the praise that is
bestowed on Timanthes; not only because it is not his
invention, but because he thinks meanly of this trick of
concealing, except in instances of blood, where the objects
would be too horrible to be seen; but, says he, "in an
afflicted Father, in a King, in Agamemnon, you, who are a
painter, conceal from me the most interesting circumstance,
and then put me off with sophistry and a veil. You are
(he adds) a feeble Painter, without resource: you do not
know even those of your Art: I care not what veil it is,
whether closed hands, arms raised, or any other action that
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
conceals from me the countenance of the Hero. You think
of veiling Agamemnon; you have unveiled your own
ignorance. A Painter who represents Agamemnon veiled
is as ridiculous as a Poet would be, who, in a pathetic
situation, in order to satisfy my expectations, and rid
himself of the business, should say, that the sentiments of
his hero are so far above whatever can be said on the
occasion, that he shall say nothing."</p>

<p>To what Falconet has said, we may add, that supposing
this method of leaving the expression of grief to the
imagination to be, as it was thought to be, the invention
of the painter, and that it deserves all the praise that has
been given it, still it is a trick that will serve but
once: whoever does it a second time will not only want
novelty, but be justly suspected of using artifice to evade
difficulties. If difficulties overcome make a great part of
the merit of Art, difficulties evaded can deserve but little
commendation.</p>

<h2>DISCOURSE IX.</h2>

<p class="center"><i>Delivered at the Opening of the Royal Academy, in Somerset Place,
October 16, 1780.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>ON THE REMOVAL OF THE ROYAL ACADEMY TO SOMERSET PLACE.&mdash;THE
ADVANTAGES TO SOCIETY FROM CULTIVATING
INTELLECTUAL PLEASURE.</p>
</div>

<p>The honour which the Arts acquire by being permitted to
take possession of this noble habitation is one of the most
considerable of the many instances we have received of
His Majesty's protection; and the strongest proof of his
desire to make the Academy respectable.</p>

<p>Nothing has been left undone that might contribute
to excite our pursuit or to reward our attainments. We
have already the happiness of seeing the Arts in a state to
which they never before arrived in this nation. This Building,
in which we are now assembled, will remain to many
future ages an illustrious specimen of the Architect's
    <a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
abilities. It is our duty to endeavour that those who gaze
with wonder at the structure may not be disappointed
when they visit the apartments. It will be no small addition
to the glory which this nation has already acquired from having
given birth to eminent men in every part of science, if
it should be enabled to produce, in consequence of this
institution, a School of English Artists. The estimation in
which we stand in respect to our neighbours, will be in
proportion to the degree in which we excel or are inferior
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
to them in the acquisition of intellectual excellence, of
which Trade and its consequential riches must be acknowledged
to give the means; but a people whose whole
attention is absorbed in those means, and who forget the
end, can aspire but little above the rank of a barbarous
nation. Every establishment that tends to the cultivation
of the pleasures of the mind, as distinct from those of
sense, may be considered as an inferior school of morality,
where the mind is polished and prepared for higher
attainments.</p>

<p>Let us for a moment take a short survey of the progress
of the mind towards what is, or ought to be, its true object
of attention. Man, in his lowest state, has no pleasures
but those of sense, and no wants but those of appetite;
afterwards, when society is divided into different ranks, and
some are appointed to labour for the support of others,
those whom their superiority sets free from labour begin to
look for intellectual entertainments. Thus, whilst the
shepherds were attending their flocks, their masters made
the first astronomical observations; so music is said to have
had its origin from a man at leisure listening to the strokes
of a hammer.</p>

<p>As the senses, in the lowest state of nature, are necessary
to direct us to our support, when that support is once
secure there is danger in following them further; to him
who has no rule of action but the gratification of the senses,
plenty is always dangerous: it is therefore necessary to the
happiness of individuals, and still more necessary to the
security of society, that the mind should be elevated to the
idea of general beauty, and the contemplation of general
truth; by this pursuit the mind is always carried forward in
search of something more excellent than it finds, and
obtains its proper superiority over the common senses of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
life, by learning to feel itself capable of higher aims and
nobler enjoyments. In this gradual exaltation of human
nature, every art contributes its contingent towards the
general supply of mental pleasure. Whatever abstracts the
thoughts from sensual gratifications, whatever teaches us to
look for happiness within ourselves, must advance in some
measure the dignity of our nature.</p>

<p>Perhaps there is no higher proof of the excellency of
man than this&mdash;that to a mind properly cultivated, whatever
is bounded is little. The mind is continually labouring to
advance, step by step, through successive gradations of
excellence, towards perfection, which is dimly seen, at a
great, though not hopeless, distance, and which we must
always follow, because we never can attain; but the pursuit
rewards itself; one truth teaches another, and our store is
always increasing, though nature can never be exhausted.
Our art, like all arts which address the imagination, is
applied to a somewhat lower faculty of the mind, which
approaches nearer to sensuality: but through sense and
fancy it must make its way to reason; for such is the
progress of thought, that we perceive by sense, we combine
by fancy, and distinguish by reason: and without carrying
our art out of its natural and true character, the more we
purify it from everything that is gross in sense, in that proportion
we advance its use and dignity; and in proportion
as we lower it to mere sensuality, we pervert its nature, and
degrade it from the rank of a liberal art; and this is what
every artist ought well to remember. Let him remember
also, that he deserves just so much encouragement in the
state as he makes himself a member of it virtuously useful,
and contributes in his sphere to the general purpose and
perfection of society.</p>

<p>The Art which we profess has beauty for its object; this
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
it is our business to discover and to express; the beauty of
which we are in quest is general and intellectual; it is an
idea that subsists only in the mind; the sight never beheld
it, nor has the hand expressed it; it is an idea residing in
the breast of the artist, which he is always labouring to
impart, and which he dies at last without imparting; but
which he is yet so far able to communicate, as to raise the
thoughts and extend the views of the spectator; and which,
by a succession of art, may be so far diffused, that its effects
may extend themselves imperceptibly into public benefits,
and be among the means of bestowing on whole nations
refinement of taste: which, if it does not lead directly to
purity of manners, obviates at least their greatest depravation,
by disentangling the mind from appetite, and conducting
the thoughts through successive stages of excellence,
till that contemplation of universal rectitude and harmony,
which, began by Taste, may, as it is exalted and refined,
conclude in Virtue.</p>

<p>SCULPTURE:&mdash;HAS BUT ONE STYLE.&mdash;ITS OBJECTS, FORM, AND
CHARACTER.&mdash;INEFFECTUAL ATTEMPTS OF THE MODERN SCULPTORS
TO IMPROVE THE ART.&mdash;ILL EFFECTS OF MODERN DRESS
IN SCULPTURE.</p>
</div>

<p>I shall now, as it has been customary on this day, and on
this occasion, communicate to you such observations as
have occurred to me on the Theory of Art.</p>

<p>If these observations have hitherto referred principally to
Painting, let it be remembered that this Art is much more
extensive and complicated than Sculpture, and affords therefore
a more ample field for criticism; and as the greater
includes the less, the leading principles of Sculpture are
comprised in those of Painting.</p>

<p>However, I wish now to make some remarks with
particular relation to Sculpture; to consider wherein, or in
what manner, its principles and those of Painting agree or
differ; what is within its power of performing, and what it
is vain or improper to attempt; that it may be clearly and
distinctly known what ought to be the great purpose of the
Sculptor's labours.</p>

<p>Sculpture is an art of much more simplicity and
uniformity than painting; it cannot with propriety, and
the best effect, be applied to many subjects. The object of
its pursuit may be comprised in two words&mdash;Form and
Character; and those qualities are presented to us but in
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
one manner, or in one style only; whereas the powers of
Painting, as they are more various and extensive, so they
are exhibited in as great a variety of manners. The
Roman, Lombard, Florentine, Venetian, and Flemish
Schools all pursue the same end by different means. But
Sculpture having but one style, can only to one style of
Painting have any relation; and to this (which is indeed
the highest and most dignified that Painting can boast), it
has a relation so close, that it may be said to be almost the
same art operating upon different materials. The Sculptors
of the last age, from not attending sufficiently to this discrimination
of the different styles of Painting, have been led
into many errors. Though they well knew that they were
allowed to imitate, or take ideas for the improvement of
their own Art from the grand style of Painting, they were
not aware that it was not permitted to borrow in the same
manner from the ornamental. When they endeavour to
copy the picturesque effects, contrasts, or petty excellencies
of whatever kind, which not improperly find a place in the
inferior branches of Painting, they doubtless imagine themselves
improving and extending the boundaries of their art
by this imitation; but they are in reality violating its
essential character, by giving a different direction to its
operations, and proposing to themselves either what is unattainable,
or at best a meaner object of pursuit. The
grave and austere character of Sculpture requires the utmost
degree of formality in composition; picturesque contrasts
have here no place; everything is carefully weighed and
measured, one side making almost an exact equipoise to
the other: a child is not a proper balance to a full grown
figure, nor is a figure sitting or stooping a companion to an
upright figure.</p>

<p>The excellence of every art must consist in the complete
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
accomplishment of its purpose; and if by a false imitation
of nature, or mean ambition of producing a picturesque
effect or illusion of any kind, all the grandeur of ideas
which this art endeavours to excite, be degraded or
destroyed, we may boldly oppose ourselves to any such
innovation. If the producing of a deception is the summit
of this art, let us at once give to statues the addition of
colour; which will contribute more towards accomplishing
this end than all those artifices which have been introduced
and professedly defended, on no other principle but that
of rendering the work more natural. But as colour is
universally rejected, every practice liable to the same
objection must fall with it. If the business of Sculpture
were to administer pleasure to ignorance, or a mere entertainment
to the senses, the Venus or Medicis might certainly
receive much improvement by colour; but the character of
Sculpture makes it her duty to afford delight of a different,
and, perhaps, of a higher kind; the delight resulting from
the contemplation of perfect beauty: and this, which is in
truth an intellectual pleasure, is in many respects incompatible
with what is merely addressed to the senses, such as
that with which ignorance and levity contemplate elegance
of form.</p>

<p>The Sculptor may be safely allowed to practise every
means within the power of his art to produce a deception,
provided this practice does not interfere with or destroy
higher excellencies; on these conditions he will be forced,
however loth, to acknowledge that the boundaries of his art
have long been fixed, and that all endeavours will be vain
that hope to pass beyond the best works which remain of
ancient Sculpture.</p>

<p>Imitation is the means, and not the end of art: it is
employed by the Sculptor as the language by which his
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
ideas are presented to the mind of the spectator. Poetry
and elocution of every sort make use of signs, but those
signs are arbitrary and conventional. The sculptor employs
the representation of the thing itself; but still as a means
to a higher end&mdash;as a gradual ascent, always advancing
towards faultless form and perfect beauty. It may be
thought at the first view, that even this form, however
perfectly represented, is to be valued and take its rank only
for the sake of a still higher object, that of conveying
sentiment and character, as they are exhibited by attitude
and expression of the passions. But we are sure from
experience, that the beauty of form alone, without the
assistance of any other quality, makes of itself a great work,
and justly claims our esteem and admiration. As a proof
of the high value we set on the mere excellence of form, we
may produce the greatest part of the works of Michel
Angelo, both in painting and sculpture; as well as most of
the antique statues, which are justly esteemed in a very
high degree, though no very marked or striking character
or expression of any kind is represented.</p>

<p>But, as a stronger instance that this excellence alone
inspires sentiment, what artist ever looked at the Torso
without feeling a warmth of enthusiasm, as from the highest
efforts of poetry? From whence does this proceed? What
is there in this fragment that produces this effect, but the
perfection of this science of abstract form?</p>

<p>A mind elevated to the contemplation of excellence,
perceives in this defaced and shattered fragment, <i>disjecta
membra poet&aelig;</i>, the traces of superlative genius, the reliques
of a work on which succeeding ages can only gaze with
inadequate admiration.</p>

<p>It may be said that this pleasure is reserved only to those
who have spent their whole life in the study and contemplation
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
of this art; but the truth is, that all would feel its
effects, if they could divest themselves of the expectation
of <i>deception</i>, and look only for what it really is&mdash;a <i>partial</i>
representation of nature. The only impediment of their
judgment must then proceed from their being uncertain to
what rank, or rather kind of excellence, it aspires; and to
what sort of approbation it has a right. This state of darkness
is, without doubt, irksome to every mind; but by
attention to works of this kind the knowledge of what is
aimed at comes of itself, without being taught, and almost
without being perceived.</p>

<p>The Sculptor's art is limited in comparison of others, but
it has its variety and intricacy within its proper bounds.
Its essence is correctness: and when to correct and perfect
form is added the ornament of grace, dignity of character,
and appropriated expression, as in the Apollo, the Venus,
the Laocoon, the Moses of Michael Angelo, and many
others, this art may be said to have accomplished its
purpose.</p>

<p>What Grace is, how it is to be acquired or conceived, are
in speculation difficult questions; but <i>causa latet, res est
notissima</i>: without any perplexing inquiry, the effect is
hourly perceived. I shall only observe that its natural
foundation is correctness of design; and though grace may
be sometimes united with incorrectness, it cannot proceed
from it.</p>

<p>But to come nearer to our present subject. It has been
said that the grace of the Apollo depends on a certain
degree of incorrectness: that the head is not anatomically
placed between the shoulders; and that the lower half of
the figure is longer than just proportion allows.</p>

<p>I know that Correggio and Parmegiano are often produced
as authorities to support this opinion; but very little
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
attention will convince us that the incorrectness of some
parts which we find in their works does not contribute to
grace, but rather tends to destroy it. The Madonna, with
the sleeping Infant, and beautiful group of Angels, by
Parmegiano, in the Palazzo Piti, would not have lost any of
its excellence if the neck, fingers, and, indeed, the whole
figure of the Virgin, instead of being so very long and
incorrect, had preserved their due proportion.</p>

<p>In opposition to the first of these remarks, I have the
authority of a very able Sculptor of this Academy, who has
copied that figure, consequently measured and carefully
examined it, to declare that the criticism is not true. In
regard to the last, it must be remembered that Apollo is
here in the exertion of one of his peculiar powers, which is
swiftness; he has therefore that proportion which is best
adapted to that character. This is no more incorrectness
than when there is given to an Hercules an extraordinary
swelling and strength of muscles.</p>

<p>The art of discovering and expressing grace is difficult
enough of itself, without perplexing ourselves with what is
incomprehensible. A supposition of such a monster as
Grace, begot by Deformity, is poison to the mind of a young
Artist, and may make him neglect what is essential to his
art&mdash;correctness of Design&mdash;in order to pursue a phantom,
which has no existence but in the imagination of affected
and refined speculators.</p>

<p>I cannot quit the Apollo without making one observation
on the character of this figure. He is supposed to have
just discharged his arrow at the Python; and, by the head
retreating a little towards the right shoulder, he appears
attentive to its effect. What I would remark is the difference
of this attention from that of the Discobolus, who is
engaged in the same purpose, watching the effect of his
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
Discus. The graceful, negligent, though animated air of
the one, and the vulgar eagerness of the other, furnish a
signal instance of the judgment of the ancient sculptors in
their nice discrimination of character. They are both
equally true to nature, and equally admirable.</p>

<p>It may be remarked that Grace, Character, and Expression,
though words of different sense and meaning, and so
understood when applied to the works of Painters, are
indiscriminately used when we speak of Sculpture. This
indecision we may suspect to proceed from the undetermined
effects of the Art itself; those qualities are exhibited
in Sculpture rather by form and attitude than by the
features, and can therefore be expressed but in a very
general manner.</p>

<p>Though the Laocoon and his two sons have more expression
in the countenance than perhaps any other antique
statues, yet it is only the general expression of pain; and
this passion is still more strongly expressed by the writhing
and contortion of the body than by the features.</p>

<p>It has been observed in a late publication, that if the
attention of the Father in this group had been occupied
more by the distress of his children than by his own
sufferings, it would have raised a much greater interest in
the spectator. Though this observation comes from a
person whose opinion, in everything relating to the Arts,
carries with it the highest authority, yet I cannot but
suspect that such refined expression is scarce within the
province of this Art; and in attempting it, the Artist will
run great risk of enfeebling expression, and making it less
intelligible to the spectator.</p>

<p>As the general figure presents itself in a more conspicuous
manner than the features, it is there we must principally
look for expression or character; <i>patuit in corpore vultus</i>;
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
and, in this respect, the Sculptor's art is not unlike that of
Dancing, where the attention of the spectator is principally
engaged by the attitude and action of the performer, and it
is there he must look for whatever expression that art is
capable of exhibiting. The Dancers themselves acknowledge
this, by often wearing masks, with little diminution in
the expression. The face bears so very inconsiderable a
proportion to the effect of the whole figure, that the
ancient Sculptors neglected to animate the features, even
with the general expression of the passions. Of this the
group of the Boxers is a remarkable instance; they are
engaged in the most animated action with the greatest
serenity of countenance. This is not recommended for
imitation (for there can be no reason why the countenance
should not correspond with the attitude and expression of
the figure), but is mentioned in order to infer from hence,
that this frequent deficiency in ancient Sculpture could
proceed from nothing but a habit of inattention to what was
considered as comparatively immaterial.</p>

<p>Those who think Sculpture can express more than we
have allowed, may ask, by what means we discover, at the
first glance, the character that is represented in a Bust,
Cameo, or Intaglio? I suspect it will be found, on close
examination, by him who is resolved not to see more than
he really does see, that the figures are distinguished by
their <i>insignia</i> more than by any variety of form or beauty.
Take from Apollo his Lyre, from Bacchus his Thyrsus and
Vine-leaves, and Meleager the Boar's Head, and there will
remain little or no difference in their characters. In a
Juno, Minerva, or Flora, the idea of the artist seems to
have gone no further than representing perfect beauty, and
afterwards adding the proper attributes, with a total indifference
to which they gave them. Thus John de Bologna,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
after he had finished a group of a young man holding up a
young woman in his arms, with an old man at his feet,
called his friends together, to tell him what name he should
give it, and it was agreed to call it The Rape of the
Sabines; and this is the celebrated group which now stands
before the old Palace at Florence.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> The figures have the
same general expression which is to be found in most of
the antique Sculpture; and yet it would be no wonder if
future critics should find out delicacy of expression which
was never intended; and go so far as to see, in the old
man's countenance, the exact relation which he bore to the
woman who appears to be taken from him.</p>

<p>Though Painting and Sculpture are, like many other arts,
governed by the same general principles, yet in the detail,
or what may be called the by-laws of each art, there seems
to be no longer any connection between them. The
different materials upon which those two arts exert their
powers must infallibly create a proportional difference in
their practice. There are many petty excellencies which
the Painter attains with ease, but which are impracticable
in Sculpture; and which, even if it could accomplish
them, would add nothing to the true value and dignity of
the work.</p>

<p>Of the ineffectual attempts which the modern Sculptors
have made by way of improvement, these seem to be the
principal; The practice of detaching drapery from the
figure, in order to give the appearance of flying in the
air;&mdash;</p>

<p>Of making different plans in the same bas-relievos;&mdash;</p>

<p>Of attempting to represent the effects of perspective;&mdash;</p>

<p>To these we may add the ill effect of figures clothed in a
modern dress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
    The folly of attempting to make stone sport and flutter
in the air is so apparent, that it carries with it its own
reprehension; and yet to accomplish this seemed to be
the great ambition of many modern Sculptors, particularly
Bernini: his art was so much set on overcoming this difficulty,
that he was forever attempting it, though by that
attempt he risked everything that was valuable in the art.</p>

<p>Bernini stands in the first class of modern Sculptors, and
therefore it is the business of criticism to prevent the ill
effects of so powerful an example.</p>

<p>From his very early work of Apollo and Daphne, the
world justly expected he would rival the best productions
of ancient Greece; but he soon strayed from the right path.
And though there is in his works something which always
distinguishes him from the common herd, yet he appears
in his latter performances to have lost his way. Instead of
pursuing the study of that ideal beauty with which he had
so successfully begun, he turned his mind to an injudicious
quest of novelty, attempted what was not within the province
of the art, and endeavoured to overcome the hardness
and obstinacy of his materials; which even supposing he
had accomplished, so far as to make this species of drapery
appear natural, the ill effect and confusion occasioned by
its being detached from the figure to which it belongs
ought to have been alone a sufficient reason to have
deterred him from that practice.</p>

<p>We have not, I think, in our Academy, any of Bernini's
works, except a cast of the head of his Neptune; this will
be sufficient to serve us for an example of the mischief produced
by this attempt of representing the effects of the
wind. The locks of the hair are flying abroad in all directions,
insomuch that it is not a superficial view that can
discover what the object is which is represented, or
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
distinguish those flying locks from the features, as they are
all of the same colour, of equal solidity, and consequently
project with equal force.</p>

<p>The same entangled confusion which is here occasioned
by the hair is produced by drapery flying off; which the
eye must, for the same reason, inevitably mingle and
confound with the principal parts of the figure.</p>

<p>It is a general rule, equally true in both Arts, that the
form and attitude of the figure should be seen clearly, and
without any ambiguity at the first glance of the eye. This
the Painter can easily do by colour, by losing parts in the
ground, or keeping them so obscure as to prevent them
from interfering with the more principal objects. The
sculptor has no other means of preventing this confusion
than by attaching the drapery for the greater part close to
the figure; the folds of which, following the order of the
limbs, whenever the drapery is seen, the eye is led to trace
the form and attitude of the figure at the same time.</p>

<p>The drapery of the Apollo, though it makes a large mass,
and is separated from the figure, does not affect the present
question, from the very circumstance of its being so completely
separated; and from the regularity and simplicity of
its form, it does not in the least interfere with a distinct
view of the figure. In reality, it is no more a part of it
than a pedestal, a trunk of a tree, or an animal, which we
often see joined to statues.</p>

<p>The principal use of those appendages is to strengthen
and preserve the statue from accidents; and many are of
opinion that the mantle which falls from the Apollo's arm
is for the same end; but surely it answers a much greater
purpose, by preventing that dryness of effect which would
inevitably attend a naked arm, extended almost at full
length, to which we may add the disagreeable effect which
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
would proceed from the body and arm making a right
angle.</p>

<p>The Apostles, in the church of St. John Lateran, appear
to me to fall under the censure of an injudicious imitation
of the manner of the painters. The drapery of those
figures, from being disposed in large masses, gives undoubtedly
that air of grandeur which magnitude or quantity is
sure to produce. But though it should be acknowledged
that it is managed with great skill and intelligence, and
contrived to appear as light as the materials will allow,
yet the weight and solidity of stone was not to be overcome.</p>

<p>Those figures are much in the style of Carlo Maratti, and
such as we may imagine he would have made if he had
attempted Sculpture; and when we know he had the
superintendence of that work, and was an intimate friend of
one of the principal Sculptors, we may suspect that his
taste had some influence, if he did not even give the
designs. No man can look at those figures without recognising
the manner of Carlo Maratti. They have the same
defect which his works so often have, of being overlaid with
drapery, and that too artificially disposed. I cannot but
believe that if Ruscono, Le Gros, Monot, and the rest of
the Sculptors employed in that work, had taken for their
guide the simple dress, such as we see in the antique
statues of the philosophers, it would have given more real
grandeur to their figures, and would certainly have been
more suitable to the characters of the Apostles.</p>

<p>Though there is no remedy for the ill effect of those
solid projections which flying drapery in stone must always
produce in statues, yet in bas-relievos it is totally different;
those detached parts of drapery the Sculptor has here as
much power over as the Painter, by uniting and losing it in
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
the ground, so that it shall not in the least entangle and
confuse the figure.</p>

<p>But here again the Sculptor, not content with this successful
imitation, if it may be so called, proceeds to
represent figures, or groups of figures, on different plans;
that is, some on the foreground, and some at a greater distance,
in the manner of Painters in historical compositions.
To do this he has no other means than by making the distant
figures of less dimensions, and relieving them in a less
degree from the surface; but this is not adequate to the
end; they will still appear only as figures on a less scale,
but equally near the eye with those in the front of the
piece.</p>

<p>Nor does the mischief of this attempt, which never accomplishes
its intention, rest here: by this division of the work
into many minute parts, the grandeur of its general effect is
inevitably destroyed.</p>

<p>Perhaps the only circumstance in which the Modern
have excelled the Ancient Sculptors is the management of
a single group in basso-relievo; the art of gradually raising
the group from the flat surface, till it imperceptibly emerges
into alto-relievo. Of this there is no ancient example remaining
that discovers any approach to the skill which Le
Gros has shown in an Altar in the Jesuits' Church at Rome.
Different plans or degrees of relief in the same group have,
as we see in this instance, a good effect, though the contrary
happens when the groups are separated, and are at some
distance behind each other.</p>

<p>This improvement in the art of composing a group in
basso-relievo was probably first suggested by the practice of
the modern Painters, who relieve their figures, or groups of
figures, from their ground, by the same gentle gradation;
and it is accomplished in every respect by the same general
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
principles; but as the marble has no colour, it is the composition
itself that must give its light and shadow. The
ancient Sculptors could not borrow this advantage from their
Painters, for this was an art with which they appear to have
been entirely unacquainted: and in the bas-relievos of
Lorenzo Ghiberti, the casts of which we have in the
Academy, this art is no more attempted than it was by the
Painters of his age.</p>

<p>The next imaginary improvement of the moderns is the
representing the effects of Perspective in bas-relief. Of this
little need be said; all must recollect how ineffectual has
been the attempt of modern Sculptors to turn the buildings
which they have introduced as seen from their angle, with a
view to make them appear to recede from the eye in perspective.
This, though it may show indeed their eager
desire to encounter difficulties, shows at the same time how
inadequate their materials are even to this their humble
ambition.</p>

<p>The Ancients, with great judgment, represented only the
elevation of whatever architecture they introduced into their
bas-reliefs, which is composed of little more than horizontal
or perpendicular lines; whereas the interruption of crossed
lines, or whatever causes a multiplicity of subordinate parts,
destroys that regularity and firmness of effect on which
grandeur of style so much depends.</p>

<p>We come now to the last consideration; in what manner
Statues are to be dressed, which are made in honour of
men, either now living, or lately departed.</p>

<p>This is a question which might employ a long discourse
of itself; I shall at present only observe, that he who
wishes not to obstruct the Artist, and prevent his exhibiting
his abilities to their greatest advantage, will certainly not
desire a modern dress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
    The desire of transmitting to posterity the shape of
modern dress must be acknowledged to be purchased at a
prodigious price, even the price of everything that is
valuable in art.</p>

<p>Working in stone is a very serious business; and it
seems to be scarce worth while to employ such durable
materials in conveying to posterity a fashion of which the
longest existence scarce exceeds a year.</p>

<p>However agreeable it may be to the Antiquary's principles
of equity and gratitude, that as he has received great
pleasure from the contemplation of the fashions of dress of
former ages, he wishes to give the same satisfaction to
future Antiquaries; yet, methinks, pictures of an inferior
style, or prints, may be considered as quite sufficient,
without prostituting this great art to such mean purposes.</p>

<p>In this town may be seen an Equestrian Statue in a
modern dress, which may be sufficient to deter future artists
from any such attempt: even supposing no other objection,
the familiarity of the modern dress by no means agrees
with the dignity and gravity of Sculpture.</p>

<p>Sculpture is formal, regular, and austere; disdains all
familiar objects, as incompatible with its dignity; and is an
enemy to every species of affectation, or appearance of
academical art. All contrast, therefore, of one figure to
another, or of the limbs of a single figure, or even in the
folds of the drapery, must be sparingly employed. In
short, whatever partakes of fancy or caprice, or goes under
the denomination of Picturesque (however to be admired
in its proper place), is incompatible with that sobriety and
gravity which is peculiarly the characteristic of this art.</p>

<p>There is no circumstance which more distinguishes a
well-regulated and sound taste, than a settled uniformity of
design, where all the parts are compact, and fitted to each
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
other, everything being of a piece. This principle extends
itself to all habits of life, as well as to all works of art.
Upon this general ground therefore we may safely venture
to pronounce, that the uniformity and simplicity of the
materials on which the Sculptor labours (which are only
white marble), prescribes bounds to his art, and teaches
him to confine himself to a proportionable simplicity of
design.</p>

<h2>DISCOURSE XI.</h2>

<p class="center"><i>Delivered to the Students of the Royal Academy, on the Distribution of
the Prizes, December 10, 1782.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>GENIUS.&mdash;CONSISTS PRINCIPALLY IN THE COMPREHENSION OF A
WHOLE; IN TAKING GENERAL IDEAS ONLY.</p>
</div>

<p>The highest ambition of every Artist is to be thought
a man of Genius. As long as this flattering quality is
joined to his name, he can bear with patience the imputation
of carelessness, incorrectness, or defects of whatever
kind.</p>

<p>So far, indeed, is the presence of Genius from implying an
absence of faults, that they are considered by many as its
inseparable companions. Some go such lengths as to take
indication from them, and not only excuse faults on
account of Genius, but presume Genius from the existence
of certain faults.</p>

<p>It is certainly true, that a work may justly claim the
character of Genius, though full of errors; and it is equally
true, that it may be faultless, and yet not exhibit the least
spark of Genius. This naturally suggests an inquiry, a
desire, at least, of inquiring, what qualities of a work and of
a workman may justly entitle a Painter to that character.</p>

<p>I have in a former discourse<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> endeavoured to impress
you with a fixed opinion, that a comprehensive and critical
knowledge of the works of nature is the only source of
beauty and grandeur. But when we speak to Painters, we
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
must always consider this rule, and all rules, with a reference
to the mechanical practice of their own particular Art.
It is not properly in the learning, the taste, and the dignity
of the ideas, that Genius appears as belonging to a Painter.
There is a Genius particular appropriated to his own trade,
(as I may call it) distinguished from all others. For that
power, which enables the Artist to conceive his subject
with dignity, may be said to belong to general education;
and is as much the Genius of a Poet, or the professor of
any other liberal Art, or even a good critic in any of those
arts, as of a Painter. Whatever sublime ideas may fill his
mind, he is a Painter, only as he can put in practice what
he knows, and communicate those ideas by visible
representation.</p>

<p>If my expression can convey my idea, I wish to distinguish
excellence of this kind by calling it the Genius of
mechanical performance. This Genius consists, I conceive,
in the power of expressing that which employs your pencil,
whatever it may be, <i>as a whole</i>; so that the general effect
and power of the whole may take possession of the
mind, and for a while suspend the consideration of the
subordinate and particular beauties or defects.</p>

<p>The advantage of this method of considering objects is
what I wish now more particularly to enforce. At the
same time I do not forget, that a Painter must have the
power of contracting as well as dilating his sight; because,
he that does not at all express particulars, expresses nothing;
yet it is certain, that a nice discrimination of minute circumstances,
and a punctilious delineation of them, whatever excellence
it may have (and I do not mean to detract from
it) never did confer on the Artist the character of Genius.</p>

<p>Beside those minute differences in things which are
frequently not observed at all, and when they are, made
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
little impression, there are in all considerable objects great
characteristic distinctions, which press strongly on the
senses, and therefore fix the imagination. These are by no
means, as some persons think, an aggregate of all the small
discriminating particulars: nor will such an accumulation
of particulars ever express them. These answer to what I
have heard great lawyers call the leading points in a case,
or the leading cases relative to those points.</p>

<p>The detail of particulars, which does not assist the
expression of the main characteristic, is worse than useless,
it is mischievous, as it dissipates the attention, and draws it
from the principal point. It may be remarked, that the
impression which is left on our mind even of things which
are familiar to us, is seldom more than their general effect;
beyond which we do not look in recognising such objects.
To express this in Painting, is to express what is congenial
and natural to the mind of man, and what gives him by
reflection his own mode of conceiving. The other presupposes
<i>nicety</i> and <i>research</i>, which are only the business of
the curious and attentive, and therefore does not speak to
the general sense of the whole species; in which common,
and, as I may so call it, mother tongue, everything grand
and comprehensive must be uttered.</p>

<p>I do not mean to prescribe what degree of attention
ought to be paid to the minute parts; this it is hard to
settle. We are sure that it is expressing the general effect
of the whole, which alone can give to objects their true and
touching character; and wherever this is observed, whatever
else may be neglected, we acknowledge the hand of a
Master. We may even go further, and observe, that when
the general effect only is presented to us by a skilful hand,
it appears to express the object represented in a more lively
manner than the minutest resemblance would do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
    These observations may lead to very deep questions,
which I do not mean here to discuss; among others, it may
lead to an inquiry, Why we are not always pleased with
the most absolute possible resemblance of an imitation to
its original object? Cases may exist in which such a
resemblance may be even disagreeable. I shall only
observe that the effect of figures in waxwork, though
certainly a more exact representation than can be given by
Painting or Sculpture, is a sufficient proof that the pleasure
we receive from imitation is not increased merely in proportion
as it approaches to minute and detailed reality; we
are pleased, on the contrary, by seeing ends accomplished
by seemingly inadequate means.</p>

<p>To express protuberance by actual relief&mdash;to express the
softness of flesh by the softness of wax, seems rude and
inartificial, and creates no grateful surprise. But to express
distances on a plain surface, softness by hard bodies, and
particular colouring by materials which are not singly of that
colour, produces that magic which is the prize and triumph
of art.</p>

<p>Carry this principle a step further. Suppose the effect of
imitation to be fully compassed by means still more inadequate;
let the power of a few well-chosen strokes, which
supersede labour by judgment and direction, produce a
complete impression of all that the mind demands in an
object; we are charmed with such an unexpected happiness
of execution, and begin to be tired with the superfluous
diligence, which in vain solicits an appetite already satiated.</p>

<p>The properties of all objects, as far as a Painter is
concerned with them, are, the outline or drawing, the
colour, and the light and shade. The drawing gives the
form, the colour its visible quality, and the light and shade
its solidity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
    Excellence in any one of these parts of art will never be
acquired by an artist, unless he has the habit of looking
upon objects at large, and observing the effect which they
have on the eye when it is dilated, and employed upon the
whole, without seeing any one of the parts distinctly. It is
by this that we obtain the ruling characteristic, and that we
learn to imitate it by short and dexterous methods. I do
not mean by dexterity a trick or mechanical habit, formed
by guess, and established by custom; but that science,
which, by a profound knowledge of ends and means,
discovers the shortest and surest way to its own purpose.</p>

<p>If we examine with a critical view the manner of those
painters whom we consider as patterns, we shall find that
their great fame does not proceed from their works being
more highly finished than those of other artists, or from a
more minute attention to details, but from that enlarged
comprehension which sees the whole object at once, and
that energy of art which gives its characteristic effect by
adequate expression.</p>

<p>Raffaelle and Titian are two names which stand the
highest in our art; one for Drawing, the other for Painting.
The most considerable and the most esteemed works of
Raffaelle are the Cartoons, and his Fresco works in the
Vatican; those, as we all know, are far from being minutely
finished: his principal care and attention seems to have
been fixed upon the adjustment of the whole, whether it
was the general composition, or the composition of each
individual figure; for every figure may be said to be a lesser
whole, though, in regard to the general work to which it
belongs, it is but a part; the same may be said of the head,
of the hands, and feet. Though he possessed this art of
seeing and comprehending the whole, as far as form is concerned,
he did not exert the same faculty in regard to the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
general effect, which is presented to the eye by colour, and
light and shade. Of this the deficiency of his oil pictures,
where this excellence is more expected than in Fresco, is a
sufficient proof.</p>

<p>It is to Titian we must turn our eyes to find excellence
with regard to colour, and light and shade, in the highest
degree. He was both the first and the greatest master of
this art. By a few strokes he knew how to mark the
general image and character of whatever object he attempted;
and produced, by this alone, a truer representation than his
master Giovanni Bellino, or any of his predecessors, who
finished every hair. His great care was to express the
general colour, to preserve the masses of light and shade,
and to give by opposition the idea of that solidity which is
inseparable from natural objects. When those are preserved,
though the work should possess no other merit, it
will have in a proper place its complete effect; but where
any of these are wanting, however minutely laboured the
picture may be in the detail, the whole will have a false and
even an unfinished appearance, at whatever distance, or in
whatever light, it can be shown.</p>

<p>It is in vain to attend to the variation of tints, if, in that
attention, the general hue of flesh is lost; or to finish ever
so minutely the parts, if the masses are not observed, or the
whole not well put together.</p>

<p>Vasari seems to have had no great disposition to favour
the Venetian Painters, yet he everywhere justly commends
<i>il modo di fare, la maniera, la bella practica</i>; that is, the
admirable manner and practice of that school. On Titian,
in particular, he bestows the epithets of <i>giudicioso</i>, <i>bello</i>, <i>e
stupendo</i>.</p>

<p>This manner was then new to the world, but that unshaken
truth on which it is founded has fixed it as a
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
model to all succeeding Painters; and those who will examine
into the artifice will find it to consist in the power
of generalising, and in the shortness and simplicity of the
means employed.</p>

<p>Many artists, as Vasari likewise observes, have ignorantly
imagined they are imitating the manner of Titian when they
leave their colours rough, and neglect the detail; but, not
possessing the principles on which he wrought, they have
produced what he calls <i>goffe pitture</i>, absurd, foolish pictures;
for such will always be the consequence of affecting dexterity
without science, without selection, and without fixed
principles.</p>

<p>Raffaelle and Titian seem to have looked at nature for
different purposes; they both had the power of extending
their view to the whole; but one looked only for the general
effect as produced by form, the other as produced by
colour.</p>

<p>We cannot entirely refuse to Titian the merit of attending
to the general <i>form</i> of his object, as well as colour; but his
deficiency lay, a deficiency, at least, when he is compared
with Raffaelle, in not possessing the power like him of
correcting the form of his model by any general idea of
beauty in his own mind. Of this his St. Sebastian is a particular
instance. This figure appears to be a most exact
representation both of the form and the colour of the model,
which he then happened to have before him; it has all the
force of nature, and the colouring is flesh itself; but, unluckily,
the model was of a bad form, especially the legs.
Titian has with as much care preserved these defects, as he
has imitated the beauty and brilliancy of the colouring. In
his colouring he was large and general, as in his design he
was minute and partial: in the one he was a genius, in the
other not much above a copier. I do not, however, speak
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
now of all his pictures: instances enough may be produced
in his works, where those observations on his defects could
not with any propriety be applied; but it is in the manner
or language, as it may be called, in which Titian and others
of that school express themselves, that their chief excellence
lies. This manner is in reality, in painting, what language
is in poetry; we are all sensible how differently the imagination
is affected by the same sentiment expressed in different
words, and how mean or how grand the same object appears
when presented to us by different Painters. Whether it is
the human figure, an animal, or even inanimate objects,
there is nothing, however unpromising in appearance, but
may be raised into dignity, convey sentiment and produce
emotion, in the hands of a Painter of genius. What was
said of Virgil, that he threw even the dung about the
ground with an air of dignity, may be applied to Titian:
whatever he touched, however naturally mean and habitually
familiar, by a kind of magic he invested with grandeur
and importance.</p>

<p>I must here observe, that I am not recommending a
neglect of the detail; indeed, it would be difficult, if not impossible,
to prescribe <i>certain</i> bounds, and tell how far, or
when, it is to be observed or neglected; much must, at
last, be left to the taste and judgment of the artist. I am
well aware that a judicious detail will sometimes give the
force of truth to the work, and consequently interest the
spectator. I only wish to impress on your minds the true
distinction between essential and subordinate powers; and
to show what qualities in the art claim your <i>chief</i> attention,
and what may, with the least injury to your reputation, be
neglected. Something, perhaps, always must be neglected;
the lesser ought then to give way to the greater; and since
every work can have but a limited time allotted to it (for
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
even supposing a whole life to be employed about one
picture, it is still limited), it appears more reasonable to employ
that time to the best advantage, in contriving various
methods of composing the work,&mdash;in trying different effects
of light and shadow,&mdash;and employing the labour of correction
in heightening, by a judicious adjustment of the parts,
the effects of the whole,&mdash;than that the time should be
taken up in minutely finishing those parts.</p>

<p>But there is another kind of high finishing, which may
safely be condemned, as it seems to counteract its own
purpose; that is, when the artist, to avoid that hardness
which proceeds from the outline cutting against the ground,
softens and blends the colours to excess; this is what the
ignorant call high finishing, but which tends to destroy the
brilliancy of colour, and the true effect of representation;
which consists very much in preserving the same proportion
of sharpness and bluntness that is found in natural objects.
This extreme softening, instead of producing the effect of
softness, gives the appearance of ivory, or some other hard
substance, highly polished.</p>

<p>The portraits of Cornelius Jansen appear to have this
defect, and consequently want that suppleness which is the
characteristic of flesh; whereas, in the works of Vandyke
we find the true mixture of softness and hardness perfectly
observed. The same defect may be found in the manner
of Vanderwerf, in opposition to that of Teniers; and such
also, we may add, is the manner of Raffaelle in his oil
pictures, in comparison with that of Titian.</p>

<p>The name which Raffaelle has so justly maintained as
the first of Painters, we may venture to say was not acquired
by this laborious attention. His apology may be made by
saying that it was the manner of his country; but if he had
expressed his ideas with the facility and eloquence, as it
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
may be called, of Titian, his works would certainly not
have been less excellent; and that praise, which ages and
nations have poured out upon him, for possessing Genius in
the higher attainments of art, would have been extended to
them all.</p>

<p>Those who are not conversant in works of art, are often
surprised at the high value set by connoisseurs on drawings
which appear careless, and in every respect unfinished;
but they are truly valuable; and their value arises from this,
that they give the idea of an whole; and this whole is often
expressed by a dexterous facility which indicates the true
power of a Painter, even though roughly exerted; whether
it consists in the general composition, or the general form
of each figure, or the turn of the attitude which bestows
grace and elegance. All this we may see fully exemplified
in the very skilful drawings of Parmegiano and Correggio.
On whatever account we value these drawings, it is certainly
not for high finishing, or a minute attention to particulars.</p>

<p>Excellence in every part, and in every province of our
art, from the highest style of history down to the resemblances
of still-life, will depend on this power of extending
the attention at once to the whole, without which the
greatest diligence is vain.</p>

<p>I wish you to bear in mind, that when I speak of an
whole, I do not mean simply an <i>whole</i> as belonging to composition,
but an <i>whole</i> with respect to the general style of
colouring; an <i>whole</i> with regard to the light and shade; an
<i>whole</i> of everything which may separately become the main
object of a Painter.</p>

<p>I remember a Landscape-painter in Rome, who was
known by the name of <span class="smcap">Studio</span>, from his patience in high
finishing, in which he thought the whole excellence of art
consisted; so that he once endeavoured, as he said, to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
represent every individual leaf on a tree. This picture I
never saw; but I am very sure that an artist who looked
only at the general character of the species, the order of the
branches, and the masses of the foliage, would in a few
minutes produce a more true resemblance of trees than
this Painter in as many months.</p>

<p>A Landscape-painter certainly ought to study anatomically
(if I may use the expression) all the objects which he
paints; but when he is to turn his studies to use, his skill,
as a man of genius, will be displayed in showing the general
effect, preserving the same degree of hardness and softness
which the objects have in nature; for he applies himself to
the imagination, not to the curiosity, and works not for the
Virtuoso or the Naturalist, but for the common observer of
life and nature. When he knows his subject, he will know
not only what to describe, but what to omit: and this skill
in leaving out is, in all things, a great part of knowledge
and wisdom.</p>

<p>The same excellence of manner which Titian displayed
in History or Portrait-painting is equally conspicuous in
his Landscapes, whether they are professedly such, or serve
only as backgrounds. One of the most eminent of this
latter kind is to be found in the picture of St. Pietro
Martire. The large trees, which are here introduced, are
plainly distinguished from each other by the different
manner with which the branches shoot from their trunks, as
well as by their different foliage; and the weeds in the
foreground are varied in the same manner, just as much as
variety requires, and no more. When Algarotii, speaking
of this picture, praises it for the minute discriminations of
the leaves and plants, even, as he says, to excite the
admiration of a Botanist, his intention was undoubtedly to
give praise even at the expense of truth; for he must have
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
known that this is not the character of the picture; but
connoisseurs will always find in pictures what they think
they ought to find: he was not aware that he was giving a
description injurious to the reputation of Titian.</p>

<p>Such accounts may be very hurtful to young artists, who
never have had an opportunity of seeing the work described;
and they may possibly conclude that this great Artist
acquired the name of the Divine Titian from his eminent
attention to such trifling circumstances, which in reality
would not raise him above the level of the most ordinary
Painter.</p>

<p>We may extend these observations even to what seems to
have but a single, and that an individual object. The
excellence of Portrait-painting, and, we may add, even the
likeness, the character, and countenance, as I have observed
in another place, depend more upon the general effect
produced by the Painter than on the exact expression of
the peculiarities, or minute discrimination of the parts.
The chief attention of the artist is therefore employed in
planting the features in their proper places, which so much
contributes to giving the effect and true impression of the
whole. The very peculiarities may be reduced to classes
and general descriptions; and there are therefore large
ideas to be found even in this contracted subject. He may
afterwards labour single features to what degree he thinks
proper, but let him not forget continually to examine,
whether in finishing the parts he is not destroying the
general effect.</p>

<p>It is certainly a thing to be wished, that all excellence
were applied to illustrate subjects that are interesting and
worthy of being commemorated; whereas, of half the
pictures that are in the world, the subject can be valued
only as an occasion which set the artist to work; and yet,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
our high estimation of such pictures, without considering, or
perhaps without knowing the subject, shows how much our
attention is engaged by the art alone.</p>

<p>Perhaps nothing that we can say will so clearly show the
advantage and excellence of this faculty, as that it confers
the character of Genius on works that pretend to no other
merit; in which is neither expression, character, or dignity,
and where none are interested in the subject. We cannot
refuse the character of Genius to the marriage of Paolo
Veronese without opposing the general sense of mankind
(great authorities have called it the triumph of Painting), or
to the altar of St. Augustine at Antwerp, by Rubens,
which equally deserves that title, and for the same reason.
Neither of those pictures have any interesting story to
support them. That of Paolo Veronese is only a representation
of a great concourse of people at a dinner; and
the subject of Rubens, if it may be called a subject where
nothing is doing, is an assembly of various Saints that
lived in different ages. The whole excellence of those
pictures consists in mechanical dexterity, working, however,
under the influence of that comprehensive faculty which I
have so often mentioned.</p>

<p>It is by this, and this alone, that the mechanical power is
ennobled, and raised much above its natural rank. And it
appears to me, that with propriety it acquires this character,
as an instance of that superiority with which mind predominates
over matter, by contracting into one whole what
nature has made multifarious.</p>

<p>The great advantage of this idea of a whole is, that a
greater quantity of truth may be said to be contained and
expressed in a few lines or touches than in the most
laborious finishing of the parts where this is not regarded.
It is upon this foundation that it stands; and the justness
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
of the observation would be confirmed by the ignorant in
art, if it were possible to take their opinions unseduced by
some false notion of what they imagine they ought to see
in a Picture. As it is an art, they think they ought to be
pleased in proportion as they see that art ostentatiously
displayed; they will, from this supposition, prefer neatness,
high-finishing, and gaudy colouring, to the truth, simplicity,
and unity of nature. Perhaps, too, the totally ignorant
beholder, like the ignorant artist, cannot comprehend an
whole, nor even what it means. But if false notions do
not anticipate their perceptions, they who are capable of
observation, and who, pretending to no skill, look only
straight forward, will praise and condemn in proportion as
the Painter has succeeded in the effect of the whole.
Here, general satisfaction, or general dislike, though
perhaps despised by the Painter, as proceeding from the
ignorance of the principles of art, may yet help to regulate
his conduct, and bring back his attention to that which
ought to be his principal object, and from which he has
deviated for the sake of minuter beauties.</p>

<p>An instance of this right judgment I once saw in a child,
in going through a gallery where there were many portraits
of the last ages, which, though neatly put out of hand, were
very ill put together. The child paid no attention to the
neat finishing or naturalness of any bit of drapery, but
appeared to observe only the ungracefulness of the
persons represented, and put herself in the posture of every
figure which she saw in a forced and awkward attitude.
The censure of nature, uninformed, fastened upon the
greatest fault that could be in a picture, because it related
to the character and management of the whole.</p>

<p>I should be sorry if what has been said should be understood
to have any tendency to encourage that carelessness
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
which leaves work in an unfinished state. I commend
nothing for the want of exactness; I mean to point out
that kind of exactness which is the best, and which is alone
truly to be esteemed.</p>

<p>So far is my disquisition from giving countenance to
idleness, that there is nothing in our art which enforces
such continual exertion and circumspection, as an attention
to the general effect of the whole. It requires much study
and much practice; it requires the Painter's entire mind;
whereas the parts may be finishing by nice touches, while
his mind is engaged on other matters; he may even hear a
play or a novel read without much disturbance. The artist
who flatters his own indolence will continually find himself
evading this active exertion, and applying his thoughts to
the ease and laziness of highly finishing the parts, producing
at last what Cowley calls "laborious effects of
idleness."</p>

<p>No work can be too much finished, provided the diligence
employed be directed to its proper object; but I have
observed that an excessive labour in the detail has, nine
times in ten, been pernicious to the general effect, even
when it has been the labour of great masters. It indicates
a bad choice, which is an ill setting out in any undertaking.</p>

<p>To give a right direction to your industry has been my
principal purpose in this discourse. It is this which I am
confident often makes the difference between two Students
of equal capacities, and of equal industry. While the one
is employing his labour on minute objects of little consequence,
the other is acquiring the art, and perfecting the
habit, of seeing nature in an extensive view, in its proper
proportions, and its due subordination of parts.</p>

<p>Before I conclude, I must make one observation
sufficiently connected with the present subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
    The same extension of mind which gives the excellence
of Genius to the theory and mechanical practice of the art,
will direct him likewise in the method of study, and give
him the superiority over those who narrowly follow a more
confined track of partial imitation. Whoever, in order to
finish his education, should travel to Italy, and spend his
whole time there only in copying pictures, and measuring
statues or buildings (though these things are not to be
neglected), would return with little improvement. He
that imitates the <i>Iliad</i>, says Dr. Young, is not imitating
Homer. It is not by laying up in the memory the particular
details of any of the great works of art that any man
becomes a great artist, if he stops without making himself
master of the general principles on which these works are
conducted. If he even hopes to rival those whom he
admires, he must consider their works as the means of
teaching him the true art of seeing nature. When this is
acquired, he then may be said to have appropriated their
powers, or, at least, the foundation of their powers, to
himself; the rest must depend upon his own industry and
application. The great business of study is, to form a
<i>mind</i>, adapted and adequate to all times and all occasions;
to which all nature is then laid open, and which may be
said to possess the key of her inexhaustible riches.</p>

<h2>DISCOURSE XII.</h2>

<p class="center"><i>Delivered to the Students of the Royal Academy, on the Distribution
of the Prizes, December 10, 1784.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>PARTICULAR METHODS OF STUDY OF LITTLE CONSEQUENCE.&mdash;LITTLE
OF THE ART CAN BE TAUGHT.&mdash;LOVE OF METHOD OFTEN A LOVE
OF IDLENESS.&mdash;PITTORI IMPROVVISATORI APT TO BE CARELESS
AND INCORRECT; SELDOM ORIGINAL AND STRIKING.&mdash;THIS
PROCEEDS FROM THEIR NOT STUDYING THE WORKS OF OTHER
MASTERS.</p>
</div>

<p>In consequence of the situation in which I have the honour
to be placed in this Academy, it has often happened that I
have been consulted by the young Students who intend to
spend some years in Italy, concerning the method of
regulating their studies. I am, as I ought to be, solicitously
desirous to communicate the entire result of my experience
and observation; and though my openness and facility in
giving my opinions might make some amends for whatever
was defective in them, yet I fear my answers have not often
given satisfaction. Indeed, I have never been sure that I
understood perfectly what they meant, and was not without
some suspicion that they had not themselves very distinct
ideas of the object of their inquiry.</p>

<p>If the information required was, by what means the path
that leads to excellence could be discovered; if they wished
to know whom they were to take for their guides; what to
adhere to, and what to avoid; where they were to bait, and
where they were to take up their rest; what was to be
tasted only, and what should be their diet; such general
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
directions are certainly proper for a Student to ask, and for
me, to the best of my capacity, to give; but these rules
have been already given; they have, in reality, been the
subject of almost all my Discourses from this place. But I
am rather inclined to think, that by <i>method of study</i>, it was
meant (as several do mean) that the times and the seasons
should be prescribed, and the order settled, in which everything
was to be done: that it might be useful to point
out to what degree of excellence one part of the Art was to
be carried before the Student proceeded to the next; how
long he was to continue to draw from the ancient statues,
when to begin to compose, and when to apply to the study
of colouring.</p>

<p>Such a detail of instruction might be extended with
a great deal of plausible and ostentatious amplification.
But it would at best be useless. Our studies will be forever,
in a very great degree, under the direction of chance;
like travellers, we must take what we can get, and when we
can get it; whether it is or is not administered to us in the
most commodious manner, in the most proper place, or at
the exact minute when we would wish to have it.</p>

<p>Treatises on education and method of study have always
appeared to me to have one general fault. They proceed
upon a false supposition of life; as if we possessed not only
a power over events and circumstances, but had a greater
power over ourselves than I believe any of us will be found
to possess. Instead of supposing ourselves to be perfect
patterns of wisdom and virtue, it seems to me more reasonable
to treat ourselves (as I am sure we must now and then
treat others) like humorsome children, whose fancies are
often to be indulged, in order to keep them in good humour
with themselves and their pursuits. It is necessary to use
some artifice of this kind in all processes which by their
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
very nature are long, tedious, and complex, in order
to prevent our taking that aversion to our studies which
the continual shackles of methodical restraint are sure
to produce.</p>

<p>I would rather wish a student, as soon as he goes abroad,
to employ himself upon whatever he has been incited to by
any immediate impulse, than to go sluggishly about a
prescribed task; whatever he does in such a state of mind,
little advantage accrues from it, as nothing sinks deep
enough to leave any lasting impression; and it is impossible
that anything should be well understood, or well done, that
is taken into a reluctant understanding, and executed with
a servile hand.</p>

<p>It is desirable, and indeed is necessary to intellectual
health, that the mind should be recreated and refreshed
with a variety in our studies; that in the irksomeness of
uniform pursuit we should be relieved, and, if I may so say,
deceived, as much as possible. Besides, the minds of men
are so very differently constituted, that it is impossible to
find one method which shall be suitable to all. It is of no
use to prescribe to those who have no talents; and those
who have talents will find methods for themselves&mdash;methods
dictated to them by their own particular
dispositions, and by the experience of their own particular
necessities.</p>

<p>However, I would not be understood to extend this
doctrine to the younger students. The first part of the
life of a student, like that of other school-boys, must
necessarily be a life of restraint. The grammar, the
rudiments, however unpalatable, must at all events be
mastered. After a habit is acquired of drawing correctly
from the model (whatever it may be) which he has before
him, the rest, I think, may be safely left to chance; always
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
supposing that the student is <i>employed</i>, and that his studies
are directed to the proper object.</p>

<p>A passion for his art, and an eager desire to excel, will
more than supply the place of method. By leaving a
student to himself he may possibly indeed be led to undertake
matters above his strength; but the trial will at least
have this advantage&mdash;it will discover to himself his own
deficiencies; and this discovery alone is a very considerable
acquisition. One inconvenience, I acknowledge, may
attend bold and arduous attempts; frequent failure may
discourage. This evil, however, is not more pernicious
than the slow proficiency which is the natural consequence
of too easy tasks.</p>

<p>Whatever advantages method may have in despatch of
business (and there it certainly has many), I have but
little confidence of its efficacy in acquiring excellence in
any art whatever. Indeed, I have always strongly suspected
that this love of method, on which some persons appear to
place so great independence, is, in reality, at the bottom, a
love of idleness, a want of sufficient energy to put themselves
into immediate action: it is a sort of an apology to themselves
for doing nothing. I have known artists who may
truly be said to have spent their whole lives, or at least the
most precious part of their lives, in planning methods of
study, without ever beginning; resolving, however, to put
it all in practice at some time or other&mdash;when a certain
period arrives&mdash;when proper conveniences are procured&mdash;or
when they remove to a certain place better calculated for
study. It is not uncommon for such persons to go abroad
with the most honest and sincere resolution of studying
hard, when they shall arrive at the end of their journey.
The same want of exertion, arising from the same cause
which made them at home put off the day of labour until
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
they had found a proper scheme for it, still continues in
Italy, and they consequently return home with little, if any,
improvement.</p>

<p>In the practice of art, as well as in morals, it is necessary
to keep a watchful and jealous eye over ourselves; idleness,
assuming the specious disguise of industry, will lull to
sleep all suspicion of our want of an active exertion of
strength. A provision of endless apparatus, a bustle of
infinite inquiry and research, or even the mere mechanical
labour of copying, may be employed, to evade and shuffle
off real labour&mdash;the real labour of thinking.</p>

<p>I have declined for these reasons to point out any
particular method and course of study to young Artists on
their arrival in Italy. I have left it to their own prudence,
a prudence which will grow and improve upon them in the
course of unremitted, ardent industry, directed by a real
love of their profession, and an unfeigned admiration of
those who have been universally admitted as patterns of
excellence in the art.</p>

<p>In the exercise of that general prudence, I shall here
submit to their consideration such miscellaneous observations
as have occurred to me on considering the mistaken
notions or evil habits, which have prevented that progress
towards excellence, which the natural abilities of several
Artists might otherwise have enabled them to make.</p>

<p>False opinions and vicious habits have done far more
mischief to students, and to Professors too, than any wrong
methods of study.</p>

<p>Under the influence of sloth, or of some mistaken notion,
is that disposition which always wants to lean on other men.
Some Students are always talking of the prodigious progress
they should make, if they could but have the advantage of
being taught by some particular eminent Master. To him
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
they would wish to transfer that care which they ought and
must take of themselves. Such are to be told, that after
the rudiments are past, very little of our Art can be taught
by others. The most skilful Master can do little more than
put the end of the clue into the hands of his Scholar, by
which he must conduct himself.</p>

<p>It is true, the beauties and defects of the works of our
predecessors may be pointed out; the principles on which
their works are conducted may be explained; the great
examples of Ancient Art may be spread out before them;
but the most sumptuous entertainment is prepared in vain,
if the guests will not take the trouble of helping themselves.</p>

<p>Even the Academy itself, where every convenience for
study is procured and laid before them, may, from that
very circumstance, from leaving no difficulties to be
encountered in the pursuit, cause a remission of their
industry. It is not uncommon to see young artists, whilst
they are struggling with every obstacle in their way, exert
themselves with such success as to outstrip competitors
possessed of every means of improvement. The promising
expectation which was formed, on so much being done
with so little means, has recommended them to a Patron,
who has supplied them with every convenience of study;
from that time their industry and eagerness of pursuit has
forsaken them; they stand still, and see others rush on
before them.</p>

<p>Such men are like certain animals, who will feed only
when there is but little provender, and that got at with
difficulty through the bars of a rack, but refuse to touch it
when there is an abundance before them.</p>

<p>Perhaps such a falling off may proceed from the faculties
being overpowered by the immensity of the materials; as
the traveller despairs ever to arrive at the end of his journey
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
when the whole extent of the road which he is to pass is at
once displayed to his view.</p>

<p>Among the first moral qualities, therefore, which a
Student ought to cultivate, is a just and manly confidence
in himself, or rather in the effects of that persevering
industry which he is resolved to possess.</p>

<p>When Raffaelle, by means of his connection with
Bramante, the Pope's Architect, was fixed upon to adorn
the Vatican with his works, he had done nothing that
marked in him any great superiority over his contemporaries;
though he was then but young, he had under his direction
the most considerable Artists of his age; and we know
what kind of men those were; a lesser mind would have
sunk under such a weight; and if we should judge from
the meek and gentle disposition which we are told was the
character of Raffaelle, we might expect this would have
happened to him; but his strength appeared to increase in
proportion as exertion was required; and it is not improbable
that we are indebted to the good fortune which first
placed him in that conspicuous situation for those great
examples of excellence which he has left us.</p>

<p>The observations to which I formerly wished, and now
desire, to point your attention, relate not to errors which
are committed by those who have no claim to merit, but to
those inadvertencies into which men of parts only can fall
by the overrating or the abuse of some real, though perhaps
subordinate, excellence. The errors last alluded to are
those of backward, timid characters; what I shall now
speak of belong to another class&mdash;to those Artists who are
distinguished for the readiness and facility of their invention.
It is undoubtedly a splendid and desirable accomplishment
to be able to design instantaneously any given
subject. It is an excellence that I believe every Artist
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
would wish to possess; but unluckily, the manner in which
this dexterity is acquired habituates the mind to be contented
with first thoughts without choice or selection.
The judgment, after it has been long passive, by degrees
loses its power of becoming active when exertion is
necessary.</p>

<p>Whoever, therefore, has this talent, must in some measure
undo what he has had the habit of doing, or at least give a
new turn to his mind: great works, which are to live and
stand the criticism of posterity, are not performed at a heat.
A proportionable time is required for deliberation and circumspection.
I remember when I was at Rome looking at the
fighting Gladiator, in company with an eminent Sculptor,
and I expressed my admiration of the skill with which the
whole is composed, and the minute attention of the Artist
to the change of every muscle in that momentary exertion
of strength: he was of opinion that a work so perfect
required nearly the whole life of man to perform.</p>

<p>I believe, if we look around us, we shall find, that in the
sister art of Poetry, what has been soon done has been as
soon forgotten. The judgment and practice of a great Poet
on this occasion is worthy attention. Metastasio, who has
so much and justly distinguished himself throughout
Europe, at his outset was an <i>Improvvisatore</i>, or extempore
Poet, a description of men not uncommon in Italy: it is
not long since he was asked by a friend, if he did not think
the custom of inventing and reciting <i>extempore</i>, which he
practised when a boy in his character of an <i>Improvvisatore</i>,
might not be considered as a happy beginning of his education;
he thought it, on the contrary, a disadvantage to him:
he said that he had acquired by that habit a carelessness
and incorrectness, which it cost him much trouble to overcome,
and to substitute in the place of it a totally different
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
habit, that of thinking with selection, and of expressing
himself with correctness and precision.</p>

<p>However extraordinary it may appear, it is certainly true,
that the inventions of the <i>Pittori improvvisatori</i>, as they
may be called, have&mdash;notwithstanding the common boast of
their authors, that all is spun from their own brain&mdash;very
rarely anything that has in the least the air of originality:&mdash;their
compositions are generally commonplace, uninteresting,
without character or expression; like those flowery speeches
that we sometimes hear, which impress no new ideas on the
mind.</p>

<p>I would not be thought, however, by what has been said,
to oppose the use, the advantage, the necessity there is, of
a Painter's being readily able to express his ideas by sketching.
The further he can carry such designs the better.
The evil to be apprehended is, his resting there, and not
correcting them afterwards from nature, or taking the
trouble to look about him for whatever assistance the works
of others will afford him.</p>

<p>We are not to suppose that when a Painter sits down to
deliberate on any work, he has all his knowledge to seek;
he must not only be able to draw <i>extempore</i> the human
figure in every variety of action, but he must be acquainted
likewise with the general principles of composition, and
possess a habit of foreseeing, while he is composing, the
effect of the masses of light and shadow that will attend
such a disposition. His mind is entirely occupied by his
attention to the whole. It is a subsequent consideration to
determine the attitude and expression of individual figures.
It is in this period of his work that I would recommend to
every artist to look over his portfolio, or pocket-book, in
which he has treasured up all the happy inventions, all the
extraordinary and expressive attitudes, that he has met with
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
in the course of his studies; not only for the sake of
borrowing from those studies whatever may be applicable
to his own work, but likewise on account of the great
advantage he will receive by bringing the ideas of great
Artists more distinctly before his mind, which will teach
him to invent other figures in a similar style.</p>

<p>Sir Francis Bacon speaks with approbation of the pro-visionary
methods Demosthenes and Cicero employed to
assist their invention; and illustrates their use by a quaint
comparison after his manner. These particular <i>Studios</i>
being not immediately connected with our art, I need not
cite the passage I allude to, and shall only observe that
such preparation totally opposes the general received
opinions that are floating in the world concerning genius
and inspiration. The same great man in another place,
speaking of his own essays, remarks, that they treat of
"those things, wherein both men's lives and persons are
most conversant, whereof a man shall find much in experience,
but little in books:" they are then what an artist
would naturally call invention; and yet we may suspect that
even the genius of Bacon, great as it was, would never have
been enabled to have made those observations, if his mind
had not been trained and disciplined by reading the observations
of others. Nor could he without such reading have
known that those opinions were not to be found in other
books.</p>

<p>I know there are many Artists of great fame who appear
never to have looked out of themselves, and who probably
would think it derogatory to their character to be supposed
to borrow from any other Painter. But when we recollect,
and compare the works of such men with those who took
to their assistance the inventions of others, we shall be
convinced of the great advantage of this latter practice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
    The two men most eminent for readiness of invention,
that occur to me, are Luca Giordano and La Fage; one in
painting, and the other in drawing.</p>

<p>To such extraordinary powers as were possessed by both
of those Artists, we cannot refuse the character of Genius;
at the same time, it must be acknowledged, that it was that
kind of mechanic Genius which operates without much
assistance of the head. In all their works, which are (as
might be expected) very numerous, we may look in vain for
anything that can be said to be original and striking; and
yet, according to the ordinary ideas of originality, they have
as good pretensions as most Painters; for they borrowed
very little from others, and still less will any Artist, that can
distinguish between excellence and insipidity, ever borrow
from them.</p>

<p>To those men, and all such, let us oppose the practice of
the first of Painters. I suppose we shall all agree, that no
man ever possessed a greater power of invention, and stood
less in need of foreign assistance, than Raffaelle; and yet,
when he was designing one of his greatest as well as latest
works, the Cartoons, it is very apparent that he had the
studies which he had made from Masaccio before him.
Two noble figures of St. Paul, which he found there, he
adopted in his own work: one of them he took for St. Paul
preaching at Athens; and the other for the same Saint
when chastising the sorcerer Elymas. Another figure in
the same work, whose head is sunk in his breast, with his
eyes shut, appearing deeply wrapt up in thought, was introduced
amongst the listeners to the preaching of St. Paul.
The most material alteration that is made in those two
figures of St. Paul is the addition of the left hands, which
are not seen in the original. It is a rule that Raffaelle
observed (and, indeed, ought never to be dispensed with),
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
in a principal figure, to show both hands; that it should
never be a question, what is become of the other hand.
For the sacrifice at Listra, he took the whole ceremony
much as it stands in an ancient Basso-relievo, since
published in the <span class="smcap">Admiranda</span>.</p>

<p>I have given examples from those pictures only of
Raffaelle which we have among us, though many other
instances might be produced of this great painter's not
disdaining assistance; indeed, his known wealth was so
great, that he might borrow where he pleased without loss
of credit.</p>

<p>It may be remarked, that this work of Masaccio, from
which he has borrowed so freely, was a public work, and at
no farther distance from Rome than Florence; so that if
he had considered it a disgraceful theft, he was sure to be
detected; but he was well satisfied that his character for
Invention would be little affected by such a discovery; nor
is it, except in the opinion of those who are ignorant of the
manner in which great works are built.</p>

<p>Those who steal from mere poverty; who having nothing
of their own, cannot exist a minute without making such
depredations; who are so poor that they have no place in
which they can even deposit what they have taken; to men
of this description nothing can be said; but such artists as
those to whom I suppose myself now speaking, men whom
I consider as completely provided with all the necessaries
and conveniences of art, and who do not desire to steal
baubles and common trash, but wish only to possess
peculiar rarities which they select to ornament their
cabinets, and take care to enrich the general store with
materials of equal or of greater value than what they have
taken; such men surely need not be ashamed of that
friendly intercourse which ought to exist among artists,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
of receiving from the dead and giving to the living, and
perhaps to those who are yet unborn.</p>

<p>The daily food and nourishment of the mind of an artist
is found in the great works of his predecessors. There is
no other way for him to become great himself. <i>Serpens,
nisi serpentem comederit, non fit draco</i>,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> is a remark of a
whimsical natural history, which I have read, though I do
not recollect its title; however false as to dragons, it is
applicable enough to artists.</p>

<p>Raffaelle, as appears from what has been said, had
carefully studied the works of Masaccio; and, indeed, there
was no other, if we except Michel Angelo (whom he likewise
imitated), so worthy of his attention; and though his
manner was dry and hard, his compositions formal, and not
enough diversified according to the custom of Painters in
that early period, yet his works possess that grandeur and
simplicity which accompany, and even sometimes proceed
from, regularity and hardness of manner. We must consider
the barbarous state of the Arts before his time, when
skill in drawing was so little understood that the best of the
painters could not even foreshorten the foot, but every
figure appeared to stand upon his toes; and what served
for drapery, had, from the hardness and smallness of the
folds, too much the appearance of cords clinging round the
body. He first introduced large drapery flowing in an
easy and natural manner: indeed, he appears to be the first
who discovered the path that leads to every excellence to
which the Arts afterwards arrived, and may, therefore, be
justly considered as one of the great Fathers of modern Art.</p>

    Though I have been led on to a longer digression
respecting this great Painter than I intended, yet I cannot
avoid mentioning another excellence which he possessed in
a very eminent degree; he was as much distinguished
among his contemporaries for his diligence and industry as
he was for the natural faculties of his mind. We are told
that his whole attention was absorbed in the pursuit of his
art, and that he acquired the name of Masaccio,
    <a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> from his
total disregard to his dress, his person, and all the common
concerns of life. He is, indeed, a signal instance of what
well-directed diligence will do in a short time; he lived but
twenty-seven years; yet in that short space carried the art
so far beyond what it had before reached, that he appears
to stand alone as a model for his successors. Vasari gives
a long catalogue of Painters and Sculptors, who formed
their taste, and learned their Art, by studying his works;
among those, he names Michel Angelo, Lionardi da Vinci,
Pietro Perugino, Raffaelle, Bartolomeo, Andrea del Sarto,
Il Rosso, and Pierino del Vaga.</p>

<p>The habit of contemplating and brooding over the ideas
of great geniuses, till you find yourself warmed by the
contact, is the true method of forming an artist-like mind;
it is impossible, in the presence of those great men, to
think, or invent in a mean manner; a state of mind is
acquired that receives those ideas only which relish of
grandeur and simplicity.</p>

<p>Besides the general advantage of forming the taste by
such an intercourse, there is another of a particular kind,
which was suggested to me by the practice of Raffaelle,
when imitating the work of which I have been speaking.
The figure of the Proconsul, Sergius Paulus, is taken from
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
the Felix of Masaccio, though one is a front figure, and the
other seen in profile; the action is likewise somewhat
changed; but it is plain Raffaelle had that figure in his
mind. There is a circumstance indeed, which I mention
by-the-bye, which marks it very particularly: Sergius Paulus
wears a crown of laurel; this is hardly reconcileable to
strict propriety, and the <i>costume</i>, of which Raffaelle was in
general a good observer; but he found it so in Masaccio,
and he did not bestow so much pains in disguise as to
change it. It appears to me to be an excellent practice,
thus to suppose the figures which you wish to adopt in the
works of those great Painters to be statues; and to give, as
Raffaelle has here given, another view, taking care to
preserve all the spirit and grace you find in the original.</p>

<p>I should hope, from what has been lately said, that it is
not necessary to guard myself against any supposition of
recommending an entire dependence upon former masters.
I do not desire that you should get other people to do your
business, or to think for you; I only wish you to consult
with, to call in, as counsellors, men the most distinguished
for their knowledge and experience, the result of which
counsel must ultimately depend upon yourself. Such
conduct in the commerce of life has never been considered
as disgraceful, or in any respect to imply intellectual
imbecility; it is a sign, rather, of that true wisdom, which
feels individual imperfection; and is conscious to itself how
much collective observation is necessary to fill the immense
extent, and to comprehend the infinite variety of nature. I
recommend neither self-dependence nor plagiarism. I
advise you only to take that assistance which every human
being wants, and which, as appears from the examples that
have been given, the greatest painters have not disdained
to accept. Let me add, that the diligence required in the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
search, and the exertion subsequent in accommodating
those ideas to your own purpose, is a business which
idleness will not, and ignorance cannot, perform. But in
order more distinctly to explain what kind of borrowing I
mean, when I recommend so anxiously the study of the
works of great masters, let us, for a minute, return again to
Raffaelle, consider his method of practice, and endeavour to
imitate him, in his manner of imitating others.</p>

<p>The two figures of St. Paul which I lately mentioned are
so nobly conceived by Masaccio, that perhaps it was not in
the power even of Raffaelle himself to raise and improve
them, nor has he attempted it; but he has had the address
to change in some measure without diminishing the
grandeur of their character; he has substituted, in the place
of a serene composed dignity, that animated expression
which was necessary to the more active employment he
assigned them.</p>

<p>In the same manner he has given more animation to the
figure of Sergius Paulus, and to that which is introduced in
the picture of St. Paul preaching, of which little more than
hints are given by Masaccio, which Raffaelle has finished.
The closing the eyes of this figure, which in Masaccio might
be easily mistaken for sleeping, is not in the least ambiguous
in the Cartoon: his eyes, indeed, are closed, but they
are closed with such vehemence, that the agitation of a
mind <i>perplexed in the extreme</i> is seen at the first glance;
but what is most extraordinary, and I think particularly to
be admired, is, that the same idea is continued through the
whole figure, even to the drapery, which is so closely muffled
about him, that even his hands are not seen; by this happy
correspondence between the expression of the countenance,
and the disposition of the parts, the figure appears to think
from head to foot. Men of superior talents alone are
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
capable of thus using and adapting other men's minds to their
own purposes, or are able to make out and finish what was
only in the original a hint or imperfect conception. A
readiness in taking such hints, which escape the dull and
ignorant, makes, in my opinion, no inconsiderable part of
that faculty of the mind which is called Genius.</p>

<p>It often happens that hints may be taken and employed
in a situation totally different from that in which they were
originally employed. There is a figure of a Bacchante
leaning backward, her head thrown quite behind her, which
seems to be a favourite invention, as it is so frequently
repeated in basso-relievos, cameos, and intaglios; it is
intended to express an enthusiastic, frantic kind of joy.
This figure Baccio Bandinelli, in a drawing that I have of
that Master of the Descent from the Cross, has adopted
(and he knew very well what was worth borrowing) for one
of the Marys, to express frantic agony of grief. It is curious
to observe, and it is certainly true, that the extremes of
contrary passions are, with very little variation, expressed by
the same action.</p>

<p>If I were to recommend method in any part of the
study of a Painter, it would be in regard to invention; that
young Students should not presume to think themselves
qualified to invent till they were acquainted with those
stores of invention the world already possesses, and had by
that means accumulated sufficient materials for the mind to
work with. It would certainly be no improper method of
forming the mind of a young artist, to begin with such
exercises as the Italians call a <i>Pasticcio</i> composition of the
different excellencies which are dispersed in all other works
of the same kind. It is not supposed that he is to stop
here, but that he is to acquire by this means the art of
selecting, first, what is truly excellent in Art, and then, what
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
is still more excellent in Nature; a task which, without this
previous study, he will be but ill qualified to perform.</p>

<p>The doctrine which is here advanced is acknowledged to
be new, and to many may appear strange. But I only
demand for it the reception of a stranger; a favourable and
attentive consideration, without that entire confidence which
might be claimed under authoritative recommendation.</p>

<p>After you have taken a figure, or any idea of a figure,
from any of those great Painters, there is another operation
still remaining, which I hold to be indispensably necessary&mdash;that
is, never to neglect finishing from nature every part of
the work. What is taken from a model, though the first
idea may have been suggested by another, you have a just
right to consider as your own property. And here I cannot
avoid mentioning a circumstance in placing the model,
though to some it may appear trifling. It is better to
possess the model with the attitude you require, than to
place him with your own hands: by this means it happens
often that the model puts himself in an action superior to
your own imagination. It is a great matter to be in the
way of accident, and to be watchful and ready to take
advantage of it: besides, when you fix the position of
a model, there is danger of putting him in an attitude
into which no man would naturally fall. This extends
even to drapery. We must be cautious in touching and
altering a fold of the stuff, which serves as a model, for
fear of giving it inadvertently a forced form; and it is
perhaps better to take the chance of another casual throw,
than to alter the position in which it was at first accidentally
cast.</p>

<p>Rembrandt, in order to take the advantage of accident,
appears often to have used the pallet-knife to lay his colours
on the canvas, instead of the pencil. Whether it is the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
knife or any other instrument, it suffices if it is something
that does not follow exactly the will. Accident in the
hands of an artist who knows how to take the advantage of
its hints, will often produce bold and capricious beauties of
handling and facility, such as he would not have thought
of, or ventured, with his pencil, under the regular restraint
of his hand. However, this is fit only on occasions where
no correctness of form is required, such as clouds, stumps
of trees, rocks, or broken ground. Works produced in an
accidental manner will have the same free, unrestrained air
as the works of nature, whose particular combinations seem
to depend upon accident.</p>

<p>I again repeat, you are never to lose sight of nature; the
instant you do, you are all abroad, at the mercy of every
gust of fashion, without knowing or seeing the point to
which you ought to steer. Whatever trips you make, you
must still have nature in your eye. Such deviations as art
necessarily requires, I hope in a future Discourse to be able
to explain. In the meantime, let me recommend to you,
not to have too great dependence on your practice or
memory, however strong those impressions may have been
which are there deposited. They are for ever wearing out,
and will be at last obliterated, unless they are continually
refreshed and repaired.</p>

<p>It is not uncommon to meet with artists who, from a
long neglect of cultivating this necessary intimacy with
Nature, do not even know her when they see her; she
appearing a stranger to them, from their being so long
habituated to their own representation of her. I have
heard Painters acknowledge, though in that acknowledgment
no degradation of themselves was intended, that they
could do better without Nature than with her; or, as they
expressed it themselves, <i>that it only put them out</i>. A
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
painter with such ideas and such habits is indeed in a most
hopeless state. <i>The art of seeing Nature</i>, or, in other
words, the art of using Models, is in reality the great object,
the point to which all our studies are directed. As for the
power of being able to do tolerably well, from practice
alone, let it be valued according to its worth. But I do
not see in what manner it can be sufficient for the production
of correct, excellent, and finished Pictures. Works
deserving this character never were produced, nor ever will
arise, from memory alone; and I will venture to say, that
an artist who brings to his work a mind tolerably furnished
with the general principles of Art, and a taste formed upon
the works of good Artists&mdash;in short, who knows in what
excellence consists, will, with the assistance of Models,
which we will likewise suppose he has learnt the art of
using, be an overmatch for the greatest painter that ever
lived who should be debarred such advantages.</p>

<p>Our neighbours, the French, are much in this practice of
<i>extempore</i> invention, and their dexterity is such as even to
excite admiration, if not envy; but how rarely can this
praise be given to their finished pictures!</p>

<p>The late Director of their Academy, <i>Boucher</i>, was
eminent in this way. When I visited him some years since
in France, I found him at work on a very large Picture,
without drawings or models of any kind. On my remarking
this particular circumstance, he said, when he was young,
studying his art, he found it necessary to use models; but
he had left them off for many years.</p>

<p>Such Pictures as this was, and such as I fear always will
be produced by those who work solely from practice or
memory, may be a convincing proof of the necessity of the
conduct which I have recommended. However, in justice
I cannot quit this Painter without adding, that in the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
former part of his life, when he was in the habit of having
recourse to nature, he was not without a considerable
degree of merit&mdash;enough to make half the Painters of his
country his imitators; he had often grace and beauty, and
good skill in composition; but I think all under the
influence of a bad taste: his imitators are indeed
abominable.</p>

<p>Those Artists who have quitted the service of nature
(whose service, when well understood, is <i>perfect freedom</i>),
and have put themselves under the direction of I know not
what capricious fantastical mistress, who fascinates and overpowers
their whole mind, and from whose dominion there
are no hopes of their being ever reclaimed (since they
appear perfectly satisfied, and not at all conscious of their
forlorn situation), like the transformed followers of
Comus&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Not once perceive their foul disfigurement;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But boast themselves more comely than before."<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Methinks, such men, who have found out so short a path,
have no reason to complain of the shortness of life, and the
extent of art; since life is so much longer than is wanted for
their improvement, or, indeed, is necessary for the accomplishment
of their idea of perfection. On the contrary, he
who recurs to nature, at every recurrence renews his
strength. The rules of art he is never likely to forget; they
are few and simple; but nature is refined, subtle, and
infinitely various, beyond the power and retention of
memory; it is necessary, therefore, to have continual
recourse to her. In this intercourse there is no end of his
improvement; the longer he lives, the nearer he approaches
to the true and perfect idea of art.</p>

<h2>DISCOURSE XIII.</h2>

<p class="center"><i>Delivered to the Students of the Royal Academy, on the Distribution of
the Prizes, December 11, 1786.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>ART NOT MERELY IMITATION, BUT UNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE
IMAGINATION.&mdash;IN WHAT MANNER POETRY, PAINTING, ACTING,
GARDENING, AND ARCHITECTURE DEPART FROM NATURE.</p>
</div>

<p>To discover beauties, or to point out faults, in the works
of celebrated Masters, and to compare the conduct of one
Artist with another, is certainly no mean or inconsiderable
part of criticism; but this is still no more than to know
the art through the Artist. This test of investigation must
have two capital defects; it must be narrow, and it must
be uncertain. To enlarge the boundaries of the Art of
Painting, as well as to fix its principles, it will be necessary
that <i>that</i> art, and <i>those</i> principles, should be considered in
their correspondence with the principles of the other arts,
which, like this, address themselves primarily and principally
to the imagination. When those connected and
kindred principles are brought together to be compared,
another comparison will grow out of this; that is, the
comparison of them all with those of human nature, from
whence arts derive the materials upon which they are to
produce their effects.</p>

<p>When this comparison of art with art, and of all arts
with the nature of man, is once made with success, our
guiding lines are as well ascertained and established as
they can be in matters of this description.</p>

<p>This, as it is the highest style of criticism, is at the same
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
time the soundest; for it refers to the eternal and immutable
nature of things.</p>

<p>You are not to imagine that I mean to open to you
at large, or to recommend to your research, the whole of
this vast field of science. It is certainly much above my
faculties to reach it; and though it may not be above yours
to comprehend it fully, if it were fully and properly brought
before you, yet perhaps the most perfect criticism requires
habits of speculation and abstraction, not very consistent
with the employment which ought to occupy, and the
habits of mind which ought to prevail, in a practical Artist.
I only point out to you these things, that when you do
criticise (as all who work on a plan will criticise more or
less), your criticism may be built on the foundation of true
principles; and that though you may not always travel a
great way, the way that you do travel may be the right
road.</p>

<p>I observe, as a fundamental ground, common to all the
Arts with which we have any concern in this discourse,
that they address themselves only to two faculties of the
mind&mdash;its imagination and its sensibility.</p>

<p>All theories which attempt to direct or to control the
Art, upon any principles falsely called rational, which we
form to ourselves upon a supposition of what ought in
reason to be the end or means of Art, independent of the
known first effect produced by objects on the imagination,
must be false and delusive. For though it may appear
bold to say it, the imagination is here the residence of
truth. If the imagination be affected, the conclusion is
fairly drawn; if it be not affected, the reasoning is
erroneous, because the end is not obtained; the effect itself
being the test, and the only test, of the truth and efficacy
of the means.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
    There is in the commerce of life, as in Art, a sagacity
which is far from being contradictory to right reason, and
is superior to any occasional exercise of that faculty;
which supersedes it; and does not wait for the slow
progress of deduction, but goes at once, by what appears a
kind of intuition, to the conclusion. A man endowed with
this faculty feels and acknowledges the truth, though it is
not always in his power, perhaps, to give a reason for it;
because he cannot recollect and bring before him all the
materials that gave birth to his opinion; for very many
and very intricate considerations may unite to form the
principle, even of small and minute parts, involved in,
or dependent on, a great system of things: though these in
process of time are forgotten, the right impression still
remains fixed in his mind.</p>

<p>This impression is the result of the accumulated experience
of our whole life, and has been collected, we do
not always know how, or when. But this mass of collective
observation, however acquired, ought to prevail over that
reason, which, however powerfully exerted on any particular
occasion, will probably comprehend but a partial view of
the subject; and our conduct in life, as well as in the
Arts, is, or ought to be, generally governed by this habitual
reason: it is our happiness that we are enabled to draw
on such funds. If we were obliged to enter into a theoretical
deliberation on every occasion, before we act, life
would be at a stand, and Art would be impracticable.</p>

<p>It appears to me, therefore, that our first thoughts, that
is, the effect which anything produces on our minds, on its
first appearance, is never to be forgotten; and it demands
for that reason, because it is the first, to be laid up with
care. If this be not done, the Artist may happen to
impose on himself by partial reasoning; by a cold
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
consideration of those animated thoughts which proceed, not
perhaps from caprice or rashness (as he may afterwards
conceit), but from the fulness of his mind, enriched with
the copious stores of all the various inventions which he
had ever seen, or had ever passed in his mind. These ideas
are infused into his design, without any conscious effort;
but if he be not on his guard, he may reconsider and
correct them, till the whole matter is reduced to a commonplace
invention.</p>

<p>This is sometimes the effect of what I mean to caution
you against; that is to say, an unfounded distrust of the
imagination and feeling, in favour of narrow, partial, confined,
argumentative theories; and of principles that seem
to apply to the design in hand; without considering those
general impressions on the fancy in which real principles of
<i>sound reason</i>, and of much more weight and importance,
are involved, and, as it were, lie hid under the appearance
of a sort of vulgar sentiment.</p>

<p>Reason, without doubt, must ultimately determine everything;
at this minute it is required to inform us when that
very reason is to give way to feeling.</p>

<p>Though I have often spoken of that mean conception of
our art which confines it to mere imitation, I must add,
that it may be narrowed to such a mere matter of experiment,
as to exclude from it the application of science, which
alone gives dignity and compass to any art. But to find
proper foundations for science is neither to narrow or to
vulgarise it; and this is sufficiently exemplified in the
success of experimental philosophy. It is the false system
of reasoning, grounded on a partial view of things, against
which I would most earnestly guard you. And I do it the
rather, because those narrow theories, so coincident with
the poorest and most miserable practices, and which are
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
adopted to give it countenance, have not had their origin in
the poorest minds, but in the mistakes, or possibly in the
mistaken interpretations, of great and commanding authorities.
We are not, therefore, in this case misled by feeling,
but by false speculation.</p>

<p>When such a man as Plato speaks of Painting as only an
imitative art, and that our pleasure proceeds from observing
and acknowledging the truth of the imitation, I think he
misleads us by a partial theory. It is in this poor, partial,
and, so far, false view of the art, that Cardinal Bembo has
chosen to distinguish even Raffaelle himself, whom our
enthusiasm honours with the name of Divine. The same
sentiment is adopted by Pope in his epitaph on Sir Godfrey
Kneller; and he turns the panegyric solely on imitation, as
it is a sort of deception.</p>

<p>I shall not think my time misemployed, if by any means
I may contribute to confirm your opinion of what ought to
be the object of your pursuit; because, though the best
critics must always have exploded this strange idea, yet I
know that there is a disposition towards a perpetual
recurrence to it, on account of its simplicity and superficial
plausibility. For this reason I shall beg leave to lay before
you a few thoughts on this subject; to throw out some
hints that may lead your minds to an opinion (which I take
to be the truth), that Painting is not only to be considered
as an imitation, operating by deception, but that it is, and
ought to be, in many points of view, and strictly speaking,
no imitation at all of external nature. Perhaps it ought to
be as far removed from the vulgar idea of imitation as the
refined civilised state in which we live is removed from a
gross state of nature; and those who have not cultivated
their imaginations, which the majority of mankind certainly
have not, may be said, in regard to arts, to continue in this
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
state of nature. Such men will always prefer imitation to
that excellence which is addressed to another faculty that
they do not possess; but these are not the persons to whom
a Painter is to look, any more than a judge of morals and
manners ought to refer controverted points upon those
subjects to the opinions of people taken from the banks of
the Ohio, or from New Holland.</p>

<p>It is the lowest style only of arts, whether of Painting,
Poetry, or Music, that may be said, in the vulgar sense, to
be naturally pleasing. The higher efforts of those arts, we
know by experience, do not affect minds wholly uncultivated.
This refined taste is the consequence of education and
habit: we are born only with a capacity of entertaining
this refinement, as we are born with a disposition to receive
and obey all the rules and regulations of society; and so
far it may be said to be natural to us, and no further.</p>

<p>What has been said may show the Artist how necessary
it is, when he looks about him for the advice and criticism
of his friends, to make some distinction of the character,
taste, experience, and observation in this Art, of those
from whom it is received. An ignorant, uneducated man
may, like Apelles's critic, be a competent judge of the
truth of the representation of a sandal; or, to go somewhat
higher, like Moli&egrave;re's old woman, may decide upon what is
nature, in regard to comic humour; but a critic in the
higher style of art ought to possess the same refined taste
which directed the Artist in his work.</p>

<p>To illustrate this principle by a comparison with other
Arts, I shall now produce some instances to show that
they, as well as our own Art, renounce the narrow idea of
nature, and the narrow theories derived from that mistaken
principle, and apply to that reason only which informs us
not what imitation is&mdash;a natural representation of a given
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
object&mdash;but what it is natural for the imagination to be
delighted with. And perhaps there is no better way of
acquiring this knowledge than by this kind of analogy:
each art will corroborate and mutually reflect the truth on
the other. Such a kind of juxtaposition may likewise have
this use, that whilst the Artist is amusing himself in the
contemplation of other Arts, he may habitually transfer the
principles of those Arts to that which he professes: which
ought to be always present to his mind, and to which everything
is to be referred.</p>

<p>So far is Art from being derived from, or having any
immediate intercourse with particular nature as its model,
that there are many Arts that set out with a professed
deviation from it.</p>

<p>This is certainly not so exactly true in regard to Painting
and Sculpture. Our elements are laid in gross common
nature&mdash;an exact imitation of what is before us; but when
we advance to the higher state, we consider this power of
imitation, though first in the order of acquisition, as by no
means the highest in the scale of perfection.</p>

<p>Poetry addresses itself to the same faculties and the same
dispositions as Painting, though by different means. The
object of both is to accommodate itself to all the natural
propensities and inclinations of the mind. The very
existence of Poetry depends on the license it assumes of
deviating from actual nature, in order to gratify natural
propensities by other means, which are found by experience
full as capable of affording such gratification. It sets out
with a language in the highest degree artificial, a construction
of measured words, such as never is, nor ever was,
used by man. Let this measure be what it may, whether
hexameter or any other metre used in Latin or Greek&mdash;or
Rhyme, or Blank Verse varied with pauses and accents, in
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
modern languages&mdash;they are all equally removed from
nature, and equally a violation of common speech. When
this artificial mode has been established as the vehicle of
sentiment, there is another principle in the human mind
to which the work must be referred, which still renders it
more artificial, carries it still further from common nature,
and deviates only to render it more perfect. That principle
is the sense of congruity, coherence, and consistency, which
is a real existing principle in man; and it must be gratified.
Therefore, having once adopted a style and a measure not
found in common discourse, it is required that the sentiments
also should be in the same proportion elevated above
common nature, from the necessity of there being an agreement
of the parts among themselves, that one uniform
whole may be produced.</p>

<p>To correspond, therefore, with this general system of
deviation from nature, the manner in which poetry is
offered to the ear, the tone in which it is recited, should be
as far removed from the tone of conversation as the words
of which that Poetry is composed. This naturally suggests
the idea of modulating the voice by art, which, I suppose,
may be considered as accomplished to the highest degree of
excellence in the recitative of the Italian Opera; as we may
conjecture it was in the Chorus that attended the ancient
drama. And though the most violent passions, the highest
distress, even death itself, are expressed in singing or
recitative, I would not admit as sound criticism the condemnation
of such exhibitions on account of their being
unnatural.</p>

<p>If it is natural for our senses, and our imaginations, to
be delighted with singing, with instrumental music, with
poetry, and with graceful action, taken separately (none of
them being in the vulgar sense natural, even in that
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
separate state); it is conformable to experience, and therefore
agreeable to reason as connected and referred to
experience, that we should also be delighted with this union
of music, poetry, and graceful action, joined to every
circumstance of pomp and magnificence calculated to strike
the senses of the spectator. Shall reason stand in the way,
and tell us that we ought not to like what we know we do
like, and prevent us from feeling the full effect of this
complicated exertion of art? This is what I would understand
by poets and painters being allowed to dare everything;
for what can be more daring than accomplishing
the purpose and end of art, by a complication of means,
none of which have their archetypes in actual nature?</p>

<p>So far, therefore, is servile imitation from being necessary,
that whatever is familiar, or in any way reminds us
of what we see and hear every day, perhaps does not belong
to the higher provinces of art, either in poetry or painting.
The mind is to be transported, as Shakespeare expresses it,
<i>beyond the ignorant present</i>, to ages past. Another and a
higher order of beings is supposed; and to those beings
everything which is introduced into the work must correspond.
Of this conduct, under these circumstances,
the Roman and Florentine schools afford sufficient examples.
Their style by this means is raised and elevated
above all others; and by the same means the compass of
art itself is enlarged.</p>

<p>We often see grave and great subjects attempted by
artists of another school; who, though excellent in the
lower class of art, proceeding on the principles which
regulate that class, and not recollecting, or not knowing,
that they were to address themselves to another faculty of
the mind, have become perfectly ridiculous.</p>

<p>The picture which I have at present in my thoughts is a
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
sacrifice of Iphigenia, painted by Jan Steen, a painter of
whom I have formerly had occasion to speak with the
highest approbation; and even in this picture, the subject
of which is by no means adapted to his genius, there is
nature and expression; but it is such expression, and
the countenances are so familiar, and consequently so
vulgar, and the whole accompanied with such finery of silks
and velvets, that one would be almost tempted to doubt
whether the artist did not purposely intend to burlesque
his subject.</p>

<p>Instances of the same kind we frequently see in poetry.
Parts of Hobbes's translation of Homer are remembered
and repeated merely for the familiarity and meanness of
their phraseology, so ill corresponding with the ideas which
ought to have been expressed, and, as I conceive, with the
style of the original.</p>

<p>We may proceed in the same manner through the
comparatively inferior branches of art. There are, in
works of that class, the same distinction of a higher and a
lower style; and they take their rank and degree in
proportion as the artist departs more, or less, from common
nature, and makes it an object of his attention to strike the
imagination of the spectator by ways belonging especially
to art&mdash;unobserved and untaught out of the school of its
practice.</p>

<p>If our judgments are to be directed by narrow, vulgar,
untaught, or rather ill-taught, reason, we must prefer a
portrait by Denner, or any other high finisher, to those of
Titian or Vandyke; and a landscape of Vanderheyden to
those of Titian or Rubens; for they are certainly more
exact representations of nature.</p>

<p>If we suppose a view of nature represented with all the
truth of the <i>camera obscura</i>, and the same scene represented
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
by a great artist, how little and mean will the one appear
in comparison of the other, where no superiority is supposed
from the choice of the subject! The scene shall be the
same, the difference only will be in the manner in which it
is presented to the eye. With what additional superiority,
then, will the same artist appear when he has the power of
selecting his materials as well as elevating his style? Like
Nicholas Poussin, he transports us to the environs of
ancient Rome, with all the objects which a literary education
makes so precious and interesting to man; or, like
Sebastian Bourdon, he leads us to the dark antiquity of the
pyramids of Egypt; or, like Claude Lorrain, he conducts
us to the tranquillity of Arcadian scenes and fairy-land.</p>

<p>Like the history-painter, a painter of landscapes, in this
style and with this conduct, sends the imagination back
into antiquity; and, like the poet, he makes the elements
sympathise with his subject: whether the clouds roll in
volumes like those of Titian or Salvator Rosa, or like
those of Claude, are gilded with the setting sun; whether
the mountains have sudden and bold projections, or are
gently sloped; whether the branches of his trees shoot out
abruptly in right angles from their trunks, or follow each
other with only a gentle inclination. All these circumstances
contribute to the general character of the work,
whether it be of the elegant or of the more sublime kind.
If we add to this the powerful materials of lightness and
darkness, over which the artist has complete dominion, to
vary and dispose them as he pleases; to diminish or
increase them as will best suit his purpose, and correspond
to the general idea of his work; a landscape thus conducted,
under the influence of a poetical mind will have the same
superiority over the more ordinary and common views, as
Milton's <i>Allegra</i> and <i>Penseroso</i> have over a cold prosaic
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
narration or description; and such a picture would make a
more forcible impression on the mind than the real scenes,
were they presented before us.</p>

<p>If we look abroad to other arts, we may observe the
same distinction, the same division into two classes; each
of them acting under the influence of two different
principles, in which the one follows nature, the other varies
it, and sometimes departs from it.</p>

<p>The theatre, which is said <i>to hold the mirror up to nature</i>,
comprehends both those ideas. The lower kind of comedy,
or farce, like the inferior style of painting, the more
naturally it is represented, the better; but the higher
appears to me to aim no more at imitation, so far as it
belongs to anything like deception, or to expect that the
spectators should think that the events there represented are
really passing before them, than Raffaelle in his Cartoons, or
Poussin in his Sacraments, expected it to be believed, even
for a moment, that what they exhibited were real figures.</p>

<p>For want of this distinction the world is filled with
false criticism. Raffaelle is praised for naturalness and
deception, which he certainly has not accomplished, and as
certainly never intended; and our late great actor,
Garrick, has been as ignorantly praised by his friend
Fielding; who doubtless imagined he had hit upon an
ingenious device, by introducing, in one of his novels
(otherwise a work of the highest merit), an ignorant man
mistaking Garrick's representation of a scene in "Hamlet"
for reality. A very little reflection will convince us, that
there is not one circumstance in the whole scene that is of
the nature of deception. The merit and excellence of
Shakespeare, and of Garrick, when they were engaged in
such scenes, is of a different and much higher kind. But
what adds to the falsity of this intended compliment is,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
that the best stage-representation appears even more
unnatural to a person of such a character, who is supposed
never to have seen a play before, than it does to those
who have had a habit of allowing for those necessary
deviations from nature which the Art requires.</p>

<p>In theatric representation great allowances must always
be made for the place in which the exhibition is represented;
for the surrounding company, the lighted candles,
the scenes visibly shifted in your sight, and the language
of blank verse, so different from common English; which
merely as English must appear surprising in the mouths
of Hamlet, and all the court and natives of Denmark.
These allowances are made; but their being made puts
an end to all manner of deception: and further, we know
that the more low, illiterate, and vulgar any person is,
the less he will be disposed to make these allowances, and
of course to be deceived by any imitation; the things in
which the trespass against nature and common probability
is made in favour of the theatre being quite within the
sphere of such uninformed men.</p>

<p>Though I have no intention of entering into all the circumstances
of unnaturalness in theatrical representations,
I must observe that even the expression of violent passion
is not always the most excellent in proportion as it is the
most natural; so, great terror and such disagreeable sensations
may be communicated to the audience, that the
balance may be destroyed by which pleasure is preserved
and holds its predominancy in the mind: violent distortion
of action, harsh screamings of the voice, however
great the occasions, or however natural on such occasions,
are therefore not admissible in the theatric art.
Many of these allowed deviations from nature arise
from the necessity which there is, that everything should
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
be raised and enlarged beyond its natural state; that the
full effect may come home to the spectator, which otherwise
would be lost in the comparatively extensive space
of the Theatre. Hence the deliberate and stately step,
the studied grace of action, which seems to enlarge the
dimensions of the actor, and alone to fill the stage. All
this unnaturalness, though right and proper in its place,
would appear affected and ridiculous in a private room:
<i>quid enim deformius qu&agrave;m scenam, in vitam transferre?</i></p>

<p>And here I must observe, and I believe it may be considered
as a general rule, that no Art can be grafted with
success on another Art. For though they all profess the
same origin, and to proceed from the same stock, yet each
has its own peculiar modes both of imitating nature, and of
deviating from it, each for the accomplishment of its own
particular purpose. These deviations, more especially, will
not bear transplantation to another soil.</p>

<p>If a Painter should endeavour to copy the theatrical
pomp and parade of dress, and attitude, instead of that
simplicity, which is not a greater beauty in life than it is
in Painting, we should condemn such pictures, as painted
in the meanest style.</p>

<p>So, also, Gardening, as far as Gardening is an Art, or
entitled to that appellation, is a deviation from nature; for
if the true taste consists, as many hold, in banishing every
appearance of Art, or any traces of the footsteps of man, it
would then be no longer a Garden. Even though we define
it, "Nature to advantage dressed," and in some sense is
such, and much more beautiful and commodious for the
recreation of man; it is, however, when so dressed, no
longer a subject for the pencil of a Landscape-Painter, as
all Landscape-Painters know, who love to have recourse to
Nature herself, and to dress her according to the principles
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
of their own Art; which are far different from those of
Gardening, even when conducted according to the most
approved principles; and such as a Landscape-Painter
himself would adopt in the disposition of his own grounds,
for his own private satisfaction.</p>

<p>I have brought together as many instances as appear
necessary to make out the several points which I wished to
suggest to your consideration in this Discourse; that your
own thoughts may lead you further in the use that may be
made of the analogy of the Arts; and of the restraint which
a full understanding of the diversity of many of their principles
ought to impose on the employment of that analogy.</p>

<p>The great end of all those arts is, to make an impression
on the imagination and the feeling. The imitation of
nature frequently does this. Sometimes it fails, and something
else succeeds. I think, therefore, the true test of all
the arts is not solely whether the production is a true
copy of nature, but whether it answers the end of art,
which is, to produce a pleasing effect upon the mind.</p>

<p>It remains only to speak a few words of Architecture,
which does not come under the denomination of an imitative
art. It applies itself, like Music (and, I believe, we
may add Poetry), directly to the imagination, without the
intervention of any kind of imitation.</p>

<p>There is in Architecture, as in Painting, an inferior
branch of art, in which the imagination appears to have no
concern. It does not, however, acquire the name of a
polite and liberal art from its usefulness, or administering
to our wants or necessities, but from some higher principle;
we are sure that in the hands of a man of genius it is
capable of inspiring sentiment, and of filling the mind with
great and sublime ideas.</p>

<p>It may be worth the attention of Artists to consider
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
what materials are in their hands, that may contribute to
this end; and whether this art has it not in its power to
address itself to the imagination with effect, by more ways
than are generally employed by Architects.</p>

<p>To pass over the effect produced by that general
symmetry and proportion, by which the eye is delighted, as
the ear is with music, Architecture certainly possesses
many principles in common with Poetry and Painting.
Among those which may be reckoned as the first, is, that
of affecting the imagination by means of association of
ideas. Thus, for instance, as we have naturally a veneration
for antiquity, whatever building brings to our
remembrance ancient customs and manners, such as the
castles of the Barons of ancient Chivalry, is sure to give
this delight. Hence it is that <i>towers and battlements</i>
    <a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> are
so often selected by the Painter and the Poet to make a
part of the composition of their ideal Landscape; and it is
from hence, in a great degree, that, in the buildings of
Vanbrugh, who was a Poet as well as an Architect, there
is a greater display of imagination than we shall find,
perhaps, in any other, and this is the ground of the effect
we feel in many of his works, notwithstanding the faults
with which many of them are justly charged. For this
purpose, Vanbrugh appears to have had recourse to some
of the principles of the Gothic Architecture; which, though
not so ancient as the Grecian, is more so to our imagination,
with which the Artist is more concerned than with
absolute truth.</p>

<p>The Barbaric splendour of those Asiatic Buildings, which
are now publishing by a member of this Academy,
    <a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> may
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
possibly, in the same manner, furnish an Architect, not
with models to copy, but with hints of composition and
general effect, which would not otherwise have occurred.</p>

<p>It is, I know, a delicate and hazardous thing (and, as
such, I have already pointed it out) to carry the principles
of one art to another, or even to reconcile in one object
the various modes of the same art, when they proceed on
different principles. The sound rules of the Grecian
Architecture are not to be lightly sacrificed. A deviation
from them, or even an addition to them, is like a deviation
or addition to, or from, the rules of other Arts&mdash;fit only
for a great master, who is thoroughly conversant in
the nature of man, as well as all combinations in his own
Art.</p>

<p>It may not be amiss for the Architect to take advantage
<i>sometimes</i> of that to which I am sure the Painter ought
always to have his eyes open&mdash;I mean the use of accidents:
to follow when they lead, and to improve them, rather
than always to trust to a regular plan. It often happens
that additions have been made to houses, at various times,
for use or pleasure. As such buildings depart from
regularity, they now and then acquire something of scenery
by this accident, which I should think might not unsuccessfully
be adopted by an Architect, in an original plan,
if it does not too much interfere with convenience. Variety
and intricacy is a beauty and excellence in every other of
the arts which address the imagination: and why not in
Architecture?</p>

<p>The forms and turnings of the streets of London and
other old towns are produced by accident, without any
original plan or design, but they are not always the less
pleasant to the walker or spectator on that account. On
the contrary, if the city had been built on the regular plan
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
of Sir Christopher Wren, the effect might have been, as we
know it is in some new parts of the town, rather unpleasing;
the uniformity might have produced weariness, and a
slight degree of disgust.</p>

<p>I can pretend to no skill in the detail of Architecture. I
judge now of the art, merely as a Painter. When I speak
of Vanbrugh, I mean to speak of him in the language of
our art. To speak, then, of Vanbrugh in the language of a
painter, he had originality of invention, he understood
light and shadow, and had great skill in composition. To
support his principal object, he produced his second and
third groups or masses; he perfectly understood in his art
what is the most difficult in ours, the conduct of the background;
by which the design and invention is set off to the
greatest advantage. What the background is in Painting,
in Architecture is the real ground on which the building is
erected; and no Architect took greater care than he that
his work should not appear crude and hard; that is, it did
not abruptly start out of the ground without expectation or
preparation.</p>

<p>This is a tribute which a Painter owes to an Architect
who composed like a painter; and was defrauded of the
due reward of his merit by the wits of his time, who did
not understand the principles of composition in poetry
better than he; and who knew little, or nothing, of what
he understood perfectly&mdash;the general ruling principles of
Architecture and Painting. His fate was that of the great
Perrault; both were the objects of the petulant sarcasms
of factious men of letters; and both have left some of the
fairest ornaments which to this day decorate their several
countries; the fa&ccedil;ade of the Louvre, Blenheim, and Castle
Howard.</p>

<p>Upon the whole it seems to me, that the object and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
intention of all the Arts is to supply the natural imperfection
of things, and often to gratify the mind by realising
and embodying what never existed but in the imagination.</p>

<p>It is allowed on all hands, that facts, and events, however
they may bind the Historian, have no dominion over
the Poet or the Painter. With us, History is made to
bend and conform to this great idea of Art. And why?
Because these Arts, in their highest province, are not
addressed to the gross senses; but to the desires of the
mind, to that spark of divinity which we have within,
impatient of being circumscribed and pent up by the world
which is about us. Just so much as our Art has of this,
just so much of dignity, I had almost said of divinity, it
exhibits; and those of our Artists who possessed this mark
of distinction in the highest degree, acquired from thence
the glorious appellation of <span class="smcap">Divine</span>.</p>

<h2>DISCOURSE XIV.</h2>

<p class="center"><i>Delivered to the Students of the Royal Academy, on the Distribution of
the Prizes, December 10, 1788.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>CHARACTER OF GAINSBOROUGH:&mdash;HIS EXCELLENCIES AND DEFECTS.</p>
</div>

<p>In the study of our art, as in the study of all arts, something
is the result of <i>our own</i> observation of nature;
something, and that not a little, the effect of the example
of those who have studied the same nature before us, and
who have cultivated before us the same art, with diligence
and success. The less we confine ourselves in the choice of
those examples, the more advantage we shall derive from
them; and the nearer we shall bring our performances to a
correspondence with nature and the great general rules of
art. When we draw our examples from remote and
revered antiquity&mdash;with some advantage, undoubtedly, in
that selection&mdash;we subject ourselves to some inconveniencies.
We may suffer ourselves to be too much led
away by great names, and to be too much subdued by
overbearing authority. Our learning, in that case, is not
so much an exercise of our judgment as a proof of our
docility. We find ourselves, perhaps, too much overshadowed;
and the character of our pursuits is rather distinguished
by the tameness of the follower than animated
by the spirit of emulation. It is sometimes of service that
our examples should be <i>near</i> us; and such as raise a
reverence, sufficient to induce us carefully to observe them,
yet not so great as to prevent us from engaging with them
in something like a generous contention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
    We have lately lost Mr. Gainsborough, one of the greatest
ornaments of our Academy. It is not our business here
to make Panegyrics on the living, or even on the dead who
were of our body. The praise of the former might bear
the appearance of adulation; and the latter of untimely
justice; perhaps of envy to those whom we have still the
happiness to enjoy, by an oblique suggestion of invidious
comparisons. In discoursing, therefore, on the talents of
the late Mr. Gainsborough, my object is, not so much to
praise or to blame him, as to draw from his excellencies
and defects matter of instruction to the Students in our
Academy. If ever this nation should produce genius
sufficient to acquire to us the honourable distinction of an
English School, the name of Gainsborough will be transmitted
to posterity, in the history of the art, among the
very first of that rising name. That our reputation in the
Arts is now only rising must be acknowledged; and we
must expect our advances to be attended with old prejudices,
as adversaries, and not as supporters; standing in
this respect in a very different situation from the late
artists of the Roman School, to whose reputation ancient
prejudices have certainly contributed; the way was prepared
for them, and they may be said rather to have lived
in the reputation of their country than have contributed
to it; whilst whatever celebrity is obtained by English
Artists can arise only from the operation of a fair and true
comparison. And when they communicate to their country
a share of their reputation, it is a portion of fame not
borrowed from others, but solely acquired by their own
labour and talents. As Italy has undoubtedly a prescriptive
right to an admiration bordering on prejudice, as a soil
peculiarly adapted, congenial, and, we may add, destined to
the production of men of great genius in our Art, we may
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
not unreasonably suspect that a portion of the great fame
of some of their late artists has been owing to the general
readiness and disposition of mankind to acquiesce in their
original prepossessions in favour of the productions of the
Roman School.</p>

<p>On this ground, however unsafe, I will venture to prophesy,
that two of the last distinguished painters of that
country, I mean Pompeio Battoni and Raffaelle Mengs,
however great their names may at present sound in our
ears, will very soon fall into the rank of Imperiale,
Sebastian Concha, Placido Constanza, Masaccio, and the
rest of their immediate predecessors; whose names, though
equally renowned in their lifetime, are now fallen into what
is little short of total oblivion. I do not say that those
painters were not superior to the artist I allude to, and
whose loss we lament, in a certain routine of practice,
which, to the eyes of common observers, has the air of a
learned composition, and bears a sort of superficial resemblance
to the manner of the great men who went before
them. I know this perfectly well; but I know likewise,
that a man looking for real and lasting reputation must
unlearn much of the commonplace method so observable in
the works of the artists whom I have named. For my own
part, I confess, I take more interest in and am more captivated
with the powerful impression of nature which Gainsborough
exhibited in his portraits and in his landscapes,
and the interesting simplicity and elegance of his little
ordinary beggar-children, than with any of the works of
that School, since the time of Andrea Sacchi, or perhaps we
may say Carlo Maratti; two painters who may truly be
said to be <span class="smcap">Ultimi Romanorum</span>.</p>

<p>I am well aware how much I lay myself open to the
censure and ridicule of the academical professors of other
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
nations, in preferring the humble attempts of Gainsborough
to the works of those regular graduates in the great
historical style. But we have the sanction of all mankind
in preferring genius in a lower rank of art to feebleness
and insipidity in the highest.</p>

<p>It would not be to the present purpose, even if I had the
means and materials, which I have not, to enter into the
private life of Mr. Gainsborough. The history of his
gradual advancement, and the means by which he acquired
such excellence in his art, would come nearer to our purposes
and wishes, if it were by any means attainable; but
the slow progress of advancement is in general imperceptible
to the man himself who makes it; it is the consequence
of an accumulation of various ideas which his
mind has received, he does not perhaps know how or when.
Sometimes, indeed, it happens that he may be able to mark
the time when, from the sight of a picture, a passage in an
author, or a hint in conversation, he has received, as it
were, some new and guiding light, something like inspiration,
by which his mind has been expanded; and is morally
sure that his whole life and conduct has been affected by
that accidental circumstance. Such interesting accounts
we may, however, sometimes obtain from a man who has
acquired an uncommon habit of self-examination, and has
attended to the progress of his own improvement.</p>

<p>It may not be improper to make mention of some of the
customs and habits of this extraordinary man; points which
come more within the reach of an observer: I, however,
mean such only as are connected with his art, and indeed
were, as I apprehend, the causes of his arriving to that
high degree of excellence which we see and acknowledge in
his works. Of these causes we must state, as the fundamental,
the love which he had to his art; to which, indeed,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
his whole mind appears to have been devoted, and to which
everything was referred; and this we may fairly conclude
from various circumstances of his life, which were known to
his intimate friends. Among others, he had a habit of continually
remarking to those who happened to be about him
whatever peculiarity of countenance, whatever accidental
combination of figure, or happy effects of light and shadow,
occurred in prospects, in the sky, in walking the streets, or
in company. If, in his walks, he found a character that he
liked, and whose attendance was to be obtained, he ordered
him to his house: and from the fields he brought into his
painting-room stumps of trees, weeds, and animals of
various kinds; and designed them, not from memory, but
immediately from the objects. He even framed a kind of
model of landscapes on his table; composed of broken
stones, dried herbs, and pieces of looking-glass, which he
magnified and improved into rocks, trees, and water. How
far this latter practice may be useful in giving hints, the
professors of landscape can best determine. Like every
other technical practice, it seems to me wholly to depend
on the general talent of him who uses it. Such methods
may be nothing better than contemptible and mischievous
trifling; or they may be aids. I think, upon the whole,
unless we constantly refer to real nature, that practice may
be more likely to do harm than good. I mention it only,
as it shows the solicitude and extreme activity which he
had about everything that related to his art; that he
wished to have his objects embodied, as it were, and distinctly
before him; that he neglected nothing which could
keep his faculties in exercise, and derived hints from every
sort of combination.</p>

<p>We must not forget, whilst we are on this subject, to
make some remarks on his custom of painting by night,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
which confirms what I have already mentioned,&mdash;his great
affection to his art; since he could not amuse himself in
the evening by any other means so agreeable to himself. I
am, indeed, much inclined to believe that it is a practice
very advantageous and improving to an artist; for by this
means he will acquire a new and a higher perception of
what is great and beautiful in nature. By candle-light,
not only objects appear more beautiful, but from their
being in a greater breadth of light and shadow, as well as
having a greater breadth and uniformity of colour, nature
appears in a higher style; and even the flesh seems to take
a higher and richer tone of colour. Judgment is to direct
us in the use to be made of this method of study; but the
method itself is, I am sure, advantageous. I have often
imagined that the two great colourists, Titian and Correggio,
though I do not know that they painted by night,
formed their high ideas of colouring from the effects of
objects by this artificial light; but I am more assured that
whoever attentively studies the first and best manner of
Guercino, will be convinced that he either painted by this
light, or formed his manner on this conception.</p>

<p>Another practice Gainsborough had, which is worth mentioning,
as it is certainly worthy of imitation; I mean his
manner of forming all the parts of his picture together;
the whole going on at the same time, in the same manner
as nature creates her works. Though this method is not
uncommon to those who have been regularly educated, yet
probably it was suggested to him by his own natural
sagacity. That this custom is not universal appears from
the practice of a painter whom I have just mentioned,
Pompeio Battoni, who finished his historical pictures part
after part, and in his portraits completely finished one
feature before he proceeded to another. The consequence
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
was as might be expected; the countenance was never well
expressed; and, as the painters say, the whole was not well
put together.</p>

<p>The first thing required to excel in our art, or I believe
in any art, is not only a love for it, but even an enthusiastic
ambition to excel in it. This never fails of success proportioned
to the natural abilities with which the artist has
been endowed by Providence. Of Gainsborough, we
certainly know, that his passion was not the acquirement
of riches, but excellence in his art; and to enjoy that
honourable fame which is sure to attend it.&mdash;That <i>he felt
this ruling passion strong in death</i> I am myself a witness.
A few days before he died, he wrote me a letter, to express
his acknowledgments for the good opinion I entertained of
his abilities, and the manner in which (he had been
informed) I always spoke of him; and desired he might
see me once more before he died. I am aware how
flattering it is to myself to be thus connected with the
dying testimony which this excellent painter bore to his
art. But I cannot prevail on myself to suppress that I
was not connected with him, by any habits of familiarity:
if any little jealousies had subsisted between us, they were
forgotten in those moments of sincerity; and he turned
towards me as one who was engrossed by the same pursuits,
and who deserved his good opinion, by being sensible of his
excellence. Without entering into a detail of what passed
at this last interview, the impression of it upon my mind
was, that his regret at losing life was principally the regret
of leaving his art; and more especially as he now began,
he said, to see what his deficiencies were; which, he said,
he flattered himself in his last works were in some measure
supplied.</p>

<p>When such a man as Gainsborough arrives to great fame,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
without the assistance of an academical education, without
travelling to Italy, or any of those preparatory studies
which have been so often recommended, he is produced as
an instance how little such studies are necessary; since so
great excellence may be acquired without them. This is an
inference not warranted by the success of any individual;
and I trust it will not be thought that I wish to make this
use of it.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that the style and department of
art which Gainsborough chose, and in which he so much
excelled, did not require that he should go out of his own
country for the objects of his study; they were everywhere
about him; he found them in the streets and in the fields,
and from the models thus accidentally found, he selected
with great judgment such as suited his purpose. As his
studies were directed to the living world principally, he did
not pay a general attention to the works of the various
masters, though they are, in my opinion, always of great
use, even when the character of our subject requires us to
depart from some of their principles. It cannot be denied,
that excellence in the department of the art which he
professed may exist without them; that in such subjects,
and in the manner that belongs to them, the want of them
is supplied, and more than supplied, by natural sagacity,
and a minute observation of particular nature. If
Gainsborough did not look at nature with a poet's eye, it
must be acknowledged that he saw her with the eye
of a painter; and gave a faithful, if not a poetical,
representation of what he had before him.</p>

<p>Though he did not much attend to the works of the
great historical painters of former ages, yet he was well
aware that the language of the art&mdash;the art of imitation&mdash;must
be learned somewhere; and as he knew that he could
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
not learn it in an equal degree from his contemporaries, he
very judiciously applied himself to the Flemish School,
who are undoubtedly the greatest masters of one necessary
branch of art; and he did not need to go out of his own
country for examples of that school; from that he learnt
the harmony of colouring, the management and disposition
of light and shadow, and every means which the masters of
it practised, to ornament and give splendour to their
works. And to satisfy himself as well as others how well
he knew the mechanism and artifice which they employed
to bring out that tone of colour which we so much admire
in their works, he occasionally made copies from Rubens,
Teniers, and Vandyke, which it would be no disgrace to
the most accurate connoisseur to mistake, at the first
sight, for the works of those masters. What he thus
learned, he applied to the originals of nature, which he
saw with his own eyes; and imitated, not in the manner of
those masters, but in his own.</p>

<p>Whether he most excelled in portraits, landscapes, or
fancy pictures, it is difficult to determine: whether his
portraits were most admirable for exact truth of resemblance,
or his landscapes for a portrait-like representation
of nature, such as we see in the works of Rubens,
Ruysdaal, and others of those schools. In his fancy
pictures, when he had fixed on his object of imitation,
whether it was the mean and vulgar form of a wood-cutter,
or a child of an interesting character, as he did not attempt
to raise the one, so neither did he lose any of the natural
grace and elegance of the other; such a grace, and such
an elegance, as are more frequently found in cottages than
in courts. This excellence was his own, the result of his
particular observation and taste; for this he was certainly
not indebted to the Flemish School, nor, indeed, to any
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
school; for his grace was not academical or antique, but
selected by himself from the great school of nature; and
there are yet a thousand modes of grace, which are neither
theirs, nor his, but lie open in the multiplied scenes
and figures of life, to be brought out by skilful and faithful
observers.</p>

<p>Upon the whole, we may justly say, that whatever he
attempted he carried to a high degree of excellence. It is
to the credit of his good sense and judgment, that he never
did attempt that style of historical painting for which his
previous studies had made no preparation.</p>

<p>And here it naturally occurs to oppose the sensible
conduct of Gainsborough in this respect to that of our
late excellent Hogarth, who, with all his extraordinary
talents, was not blessed with this knowledge of his own
deficiency, or of the bounds which were set to the extent
of his own powers. After this admirable artist had spent
the greater part of his life in an active, busy, and, we may
add, successful attention to the ridicule of life; after he
had invented a new species of dramatic painting, in which
probably he will never be equalled, and had stored his
mind with infinite materials to explain and illustrate the
domestic and familiar scenes of common life, which were
generally, and ought to have been always, the subject of
his pencil; he very imprudently, or rather presumptuously,
attempted the great historical style, for which his previous
habits had by no means prepared him: he was indeed so
entirely unacquainted with the principles of this style, that
he was not even aware that any artificial preparation was
at all necessary. It is to be regretted that any part of
the life of such a genius should be fruitlessly employed.
Let his failure teach us not to indulge ourselves in the
vain imagination, that by a momentary resolution we can
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
give either dexterity to the hand, or a new habit to the
mind.</p>

<p>I have, however, little doubt, but that the same sagacity
which enabled those two extraordinary men to discover
their true object, and the peculiar excellence of that branch
of art which they cultivated, would have been equally
effectual in discovering the principles of the higher style,
if they had investigated those principles with the same
eager industry which they exerted in their own department.
As Gainsborough never attempted the heroic style, so
neither did he destroy the character and uniformity of his
own style by the idle affectation of introducing mythological
learning in any of his pictures. Of this boyish folly we
see instances enough, even in the works of great painters.
When the Dutch School attempt this poetry of our art in
their landscapes, their performances are beneath criticism;
they become only an object of laughter. This practice is
hardly excusable even in Claude Lorrain, who had shown
more discretion if he had never meddled with such subjects.</p>

<p>Our late ingenious Academician, Wilson, has, I fear,
been guilty, like many of his predecessors, of introducing
gods and goddesses, ideal beings, into scenes which were by
no means prepared to receive such personages. His landscapes
were in reality too near common nature to admit
supernatural objects. In consequence of this mistake, in a
very admirable picture of a storm, which I have seen of his
hand, many figures are introduced in the foreground, some
in apparent distress, and some struck dead, as a spectator
would naturally suppose, by the lightning; had not the
painter injudiciously (as I think) rather chosen that their
death should be imputed to a little Apollo, who appears in
the sky, with his bent bow, and that those figures should be
considered as the children of Niobe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
    To manage a subject of this kind, a peculiar style of
art is required; and it can only be done without
impropriety, or even without ridicule, when we adapt the
character of the landscape, and that, too, in all its parts, to
the historical or poetical representation. This is a very
difficult adventure, and it requires a mind thrown back two
thousand years, and, as it were, naturalised in antiquity, like
that of Nicolo Poussin, to achieve it. In the picture
alluded to, the first idea that presents itself is that of
wonder, at seeing a figure in so uncommon a situation as
that in which the Apollo is placed; for the clouds on
which he kneels have not the appearance of being able
to support him; they have neither the substance nor the
form fit for the receptacle of a human figure; and they do
not possess in any respect that romantic character which is
appropriated to such an object, and which alone can
harmonise with poetical stories.</p>

<p>It appears to me that such conduct is no less absurd
than if a plain man, giving a relation of real distress
occasioned by an inundation accompanied with thunder and
lightning, should, instead of simply relating the event,
take it into his head, in order to give a grace to his
narration, to talk of Jupiter Pluvius, or Jupiter and his
thunderbolts, or any other figurative idea; an intermixture
which, though in poetry, with its proper preparations and
accompaniments, it might be managed with effect, yet in the
instance before us would counteract the purpose of the
narrator, and, instead of being interesting, would be only
ridiculous.</p>

<p>The Dutch and Flemish style of landscape, not even
excepting those of Rubens, is unfit for poetical subjects;
but to explain in what this ineptitude consists, or to point
out all the circumstances that give nobleness, grandeur,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
and the poetic character, to style, in landscape, would
require a long discourse of itself; and the end would be
then perhaps but imperfectly attained. The painter who
is ambitious of this perilous excellence must catch his inspiration
from those who have cultivated with success the poetry,
as it may be called, of the art; and they are few indeed.</p>

<p>I cannot quit this subject without mentioning two
examples which occur to me at present, in which the
poetical style of landscape may be seen happily executed:
the one is Jacob's Dream, by Salvator Rosa, and the other
the return of the Ark from Captivity, by Sebastian
Bourdon. With whatever dignity those histories are presented
to us in the language of Scripture, this style of
painting possesses the same power of inspiring sentiments
of grandeur and sublimity, and is able to communicate
them to subjects which appear by no means adapted to
receive them. A ladder against the sky has no very
promising appearance of possessing a capacity to excite any
heroic ideas; and the Ark, in the hands of a second-rate
master, would have little more effect than a common
waggon on the highway: yet those subjects are so poetically
treated throughout, the parts have such a correspondence
with each other, and the whole and every part of the scene
is so visionary, that it is impossible to look at them without
feeling, in some measure, the enthusiasm which seems
to have inspired the painters.</p>

<p>By continual contemplation of such works, a sense of the
higher excellencies of art will by degrees dawn on the
imagination; at every review that sense will become more
and more assured, until we come to enjoy a sober certainty
of the real existence (if I may so express myself) of those
almost ideal beauties; and the artist will then find no
difficulty in fixing in his mind the principles by which the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
impression is produced; which he will feel and practise,
though they are perhaps too delicate and refined, and too
peculiar to the imitative art, to be conveyed to the mind by
any other means.</p>

<p>To return to Gainsborough; the peculiarity of his
manner, or style, or we may call it&mdash;the language in which
he expressed his ideas, has been considered by many as his
greatest defect. But without altogether wishing to enter
into the discussion&mdash;whether this peculiarity was a defect
or not, intermixed, as it was, with great beauties, of some
of which it was probably the cause, it becomes a proper
subject of criticism and inquiry to a painter.</p>

<p>A novelty and peculiarity of manner, as it is often a
cause of our approbation, so likewise it is often a ground of
censure; as being contrary to the practice of other
painters, in whose manner we have been initiated, and in
whose favour we have perhaps been prepossessed from our
infancy; for, fond as we are of novelty, we are upon the
whole creatures of habit. However, it is certain, that all
those odd scratches and marks, which, on a close examination,
are so observable in Gainsborough's pictures, and
which even to experienced painters appear rather the effect
of accident than design: this chaos, this uncouth and
shapeless appearance, by a kind of magic, at a certain
distance assumes form, and all the parts seem to drop into
their proper places, so that we can hardly refuse acknowledging
the full effect of diligence, under the appearance of
chance and hasty negligence. That Gainsborough himself
considered this peculiarity in his manner, and the power it
possesses of exciting surprise, as a beauty in his works, I
think may be inferred from the eager desire which we
know he always expressed, that his pictures, at the
Exhibition, should be seen near, as well as at a distance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
    The slightness which we see in his best works cannot
always be imputed to negligence. However they may
appear to superficial observers, painters know very well
that a steady attention to the general effect takes up more
time, and is much more laborious to the mind, than any
mode of high finishing, or smoothness, without such attention.
His <i>handling</i>, <i>the manner of leaving the colours</i>,
or, in other words, the methods he used for producing the
effect, had very much the appearance of the work of an
artist who had never learned from others the usual and
regular practice belonging to the art; but still, like a man
of strong intuitive perception of what was required, he
found out a way of his own to accomplish his purpose.</p>

<p>It is no disgrace to the genius of Gainsborough to compare
him to such men as we sometimes meet with, whose
natural eloquence appears even in speaking a language
which they can scarce be said to understand; and who,
without knowing the appropriate expression of almost any
one idea, contrive to communicate the lively and forcible
impressions of an energetic mind.</p>

<p>I think some apology may reasonably be made for his
manner without violating truth, or running any risk of
poisoning the minds of the younger students, by propagating
false criticism, for the sake of raising the
character of a favourite artist. It must be allowed, that
this hatching manner of Gainsborough did very much
contribute to the lightness of effect which is so eminent a
beauty in his pictures; as, on the contrary, much smoothness,
and uniting the colours, is apt to produce heaviness.
Every artist must have remarked how often that lightness
of hand which was in his dead colour, or first painting,
escaped in the finishing when he had determined the parts
with more precision; and another loss he often experiences,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
which is of greater consequence: whilst he is employed in
the detail, the effect of the whole together is either forgotten
or neglected. The likeness of a portrait, as I have
formerly observed, consists more in preserving the general
effect of the countenance than in the most minute finishing
of the features, or any of the particular parts. Now
Gainsborough's portraits were often little more, in regard
to finishing, or determining the form of the features, than
what generally attends a dead colour; but as he was
always attentive to the general effect, or whole together, I
have often imagined that this unfinished manner contributed
even to that striking resemblance for which his
portraits are so remarkable. Though this opinion may be
considered as fanciful, yet I think a plausible reason may
be given why such a mode of painting should have such
an effect. It is presupposed that in this undetermined
manner there is in the general effect enough to remind
the spectator of the original; the imagination supplies the
rest, and perhaps more satisfactorily to himself, if not
more exactly, than the artist, with all his care, could
possibly have done. At the same time it must be acknowledged
there is one evil attending this mode; that if the
portrait were seen previous to any knowledge of the
original, different persons would form different ideas, and
all would be disappointed at not finding the original correspond
with their own conceptions; under the great
latitude which indistinctness gives to the imagination to
assume almost what character or form it pleases.</p>

<p>Every artist has some favourite part, on which he fixes
his attention, and which he pursues with such eagerness,
that it absorbs every other consideration; and he often
falls into the opposite error of that which he would avoid,
which is always ready to receive him. Now Gainsborough,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
having truly a painter's eye for colouring, cultivated those
effects of the art which proceed from colours: and sometimes
appears to be indifferent to or to neglect other excellencies.
Whatever defects are acknowledged, let him still
experience from us the same candour that we so freely
give upon similar occasions to the ancient masters; let us
not encourage that fastidious disposition, which is discontented
with everything short of perfection, and unreasonably
require, as we sometimes do, a union of excellencies,
not perhaps quite compatible with each other. We may,
on this ground, say even of the divine Raffaelle, that he
might have finished his picture as highly and as correctly,
as was his custom, without heaviness of manner; and that
Poussin might have preserved all his precision without
hardness or dryness.</p>

<p>To show the difficulty of uniting solidity with lightness
of manner, we may produce a picture of Rubens in the
church of St. Gudule, at Brussels, as an example; the subject
is "Christ's Charge to Peter;" which, as it is the highest
and smoothest finished picture I remember to have seen
of that master, so it is by far the heaviest; and if I had
found it in any other place, I should have suspected it to
be a copy; for painters know very well, that it is principally
by this air of facility, or the want of it, that originals are
distinguished from copies. A lightness of effect produced
by colour, and that produced by facility of handling, are
generally united; a copy may preserve something of the
one, it is true, but hardly ever of the other; a connoisseur,
therefore, finds it often necessary to look carefully into the
picture before he determines on its originality. Gainsborough
possessed this quality of lightness of manner and
effect, I think, to an unexampled degree of excellence; but
it must be acknowledged, at the same time, that the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
sacrifice which he made to this ornament of our art was too
great; it was, in reality, preferring the lesser excellencies
to the greater.</p>

<p>To conclude. However we may apologise for the deficiencies
of Gainsborough (I mean particularly his want of
precision and finishing), who so ingeniously contrived to
cover his defects by his beauties; and who cultivated that
department of art, where such defects are more easily
excused; you are to remember, that no apology can be
made for this deficiency, in that style which this Academy
teaches, and which ought to be the object of your pursuit.
It will be necessary for you, in the first place, never to lose
sight of the great rules and principles of the art, as they
are collected from the full body of the best general practice,
and the most constant and uniform experience; this
must be the groundwork of all your studies: afterwards
you may profit, as in this case I wish you to profit, by the
peculiar experience and personal talents of artists, living
and dead; you may derive lights, and catch hints, from
their practice; but the moment you turn them into models,
you fall infinitely below them; you may be corrupted by
excellencies, not so much belonging to the art, as personal
and appropriated to the artist; and become bad copies of
good painters, instead of excellent imitators of the great
universal truth of things.</p>

<h2>DISCOURSE XV.</h2>

<p class="center"><i>Delivered to the Students of the Royal Academy, on the Distribution of
the Prizes, December 10, 1790.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>THE PRESIDENT TAKES LEAVE OF THE ACADEMY.&mdash;A REVIEW OF
THE DISCOURSES.&mdash;THE STUDY OF THE WORKS OF MICHEL ANGELO
RECOMMENDED.</p>
</div>

<p>The intimate connection which I have had with the Royal
Academy ever since its establishment, the social duties in
which we have all mutually engaged for so many years,
make any profession of attachment to this Institution, on
my part, altogether superfluous; the influence of habit
alone in such a connection would naturally have produced it.</p>

<p>Among men united in the same body, and engaged in the
same pursuit, along with permanent friendship occasional
differences will arise. In these disputes men are naturally
too favourable to themselves, and think, perhaps, too hardly
of their antagonists. But composed and constituted as we
are, those little contentions will be lost to others, and they
ought certainly to be lost amongst ourselves in mutual
esteem for talents and acquirements: every controversy
ought to be, and I am persuaded will be, sunk in our zeal
for the perfection of our common Art.</p>

<p>In parting with the Academy, I shall remember with
pride, affection, and gratitude, the support with which
I have almost uniformly been honoured from the commencement
of our intercourse. I shall leave you, Gentlemen,
with unaffected cordial wishes for your future
concord, and with a well-founded hope, that in that
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
concord the auspicious and not obscure origin of our
Academy may be forgotten in the splendour of your
succeeding prospects.</p>

<p>My age, and my infirmities still more than my age, make
it probable that this will be the last time I shall have the
honour of addressing you from this place. Excluded as I
am, <i>spatiis iniquis</i>, from indulging my imagination with a
distant and forward perspective of life, I may be excused if
I turn my eyes back on the way which I have passed.</p>

<p>We may assume to ourselves, I should hope, the credit of
having endeavoured, at least, to fill with propriety that
middle station which we hold in the general connection of
things. Our predecessors have laboured for our advantage,
we labour for our successors; and though we have done no
more in this mutual intercourse and reciprocation of benefits
than has been effected by other societies formed in this
nation for the advancement of useful and ornamental
knowledge, yet there is one circumstance which appears to
give us an higher claim than the credit of merely doing our
duty. What I at present allude to is the honour of having
been, some of us, the first contrivers, and all of us the
promoters and supporters, of the annual Exhibition. This
scheme could only have originated from Artists already in
possession of the favour of the public, as it would not have
been so much in the power of others to have excited
curiosity. It must be remembered that, for the sake of
bringing forward into notice concealed merit, they incurred
the risk of producing rivals to themselves; they voluntarily
entered the lists, and ran the race a second time for the
prize which they had already won.</p>

<p>When we take a review of the several departments of the
Institution, I think we may safely congratulate ourselves
on our good fortune in having hitherto seen the chairs of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
our Professors filled with men of distinguished abilities,
and who have so well acquitted themselves of their duty in
their several departments. I look upon it to be of importance,
that none of them should be ever left unfilled: a
neglect to provide for qualified persons is to produce a
neglect of qualifications.</p>

<p>In this honourable rank of Professors I have not
presumed to class myself; though in the Discourses which
I have had the honour of delivering from this place, while
in one respect I may be considered as a volunteer, in
another view it seems as if I was involuntarily pressed into
this service. If prizes were to be given, it appeared not
only proper, but almost indispensably necessary, that something
should be said by the President on the delivery of
those prizes: and the President, for his own credit, would
wish to say something more than mere words of compliment,
which, by being frequently repeated, would soon
become flat and uninteresting, and by being uttered to
many, would at last become a distinction to none: I thought,
therefore, if I were to preface this compliment with some
instructive observations on the Art, when we crowned
merit in the Artists whom we rewarded, I might do
something to animate and guide them in their future
attempts.</p>

<p>I am truly sensible how unequal I have been to the
expression of my own ideas. To develop the latent excellencies,
and draw out the interior principles of our art
requires more skill and practice in writing than is likely to
be possessed by a man perpetually occupied in the use of the
pencil and the pallet. It is for that reason, perhaps, that
the sister Art has had the advantage of better criticism.
Poets are naturally writers of prose. They may be said to
be practising only an inferior department of their own art,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
when they are explaining and expatiating upon its most
refined principles. But still such difficulties ought not to
deter Artists, who are not prevented by other engagements,
from putting their thoughts in order as well as they can,
and from giving to the public the result of their experience.
The knowledge which an Artist has of his subject will more
than compensate for any want of elegance in the manner of
treating it, or even of perspicuity, which is still more
essential; and I am convinced that one short essay written
by a Painter will contribute more to advance the theory of
our art than a thousand volumes such as we sometimes see;
the purpose of which appears to be rather to display the
refinement of the Author's own conceptions of impossible
practice, than to convey useful knowledge or instruction of
any kind whatever. An Artist knows what is, and what
is not, within the province of his art to perform; and is
not likely to be for ever teasing the poor Student with the
beauties of mixed passions, or to perplex him with an
imaginary union of excellencies incompatible with each other.</p>

<p>To this work, however, I could not be said to come
totally unprovided with materials. I had seen much, and
I had thought much upon what I had seen; I had something
of an habit of investigation, and a disposition to
reduce all that I observed and felt in my own mind to
method and system; but never having seen what I myself
knew distinctly placed before me on paper, I knew nothing
correctly. To put those ideas into something like order
was, to my inexperience, no easy task. The composition,
the <i>ponere totum</i> even of a single Discourse, as well as of a
single statue, was the most difficult part, as perhaps it is of
every other art, and most requires the hand of a master.</p>

<p>For the manner, whatever deficiency there was, I might
reasonably expect indulgence; but I thought it indispensably
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
necessary well to consider the opinions which
were to be given out from this place, and under the
sanction of a Royal Academy; I therefore examined not
only my own opinions, but likewise the opinions of others.
I found in the course of this research many precepts and
rules established in our art, which did not seem to me
altogether reconcilable with each other, yet each seemed
in itself to have the same claim of being supported by truth
and nature; and this claim, irreconcilable as they may be
thought, they do in reality alike possess.</p>

<p>To clear away those difficulties, and reconcile those
contrary opinions, it became necessary to distinguish the
greater truth, as it may be called, from the lesser truth;
the larger and more liberal idea of nature from the more
narrow and confined; that which addresses itself to the
imagination from that which is solely addressed to the eye.
In consequence of this discrimination, the different
branches of our art, to which those different truths were
referred, were perceived to make so wide a separation, and
put on so new an appearance, that they seemed scarcely to
have proceeded from the same general stock. The different
rules and regulations which presided over each department
of art followed of course: every mode of excellence, from
the grand style of the Roman and Florentine Schools down
to the lowest rank of still life, had its due weight and
value&mdash;fitted some class or other; and nothing was thrown
away. By this disposition of our art into classes, that
perplexity and confusion, which I apprehend every Artist
has at some time experienced from the variety of styles
and the variety of excellence with which he is surrounded,
is, I should hope, in some measure removed, and the
student better enabled to judge for himself what peculiarly
belongs to his own particular pursuit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
    In reviewing my Discourses, it is no small satisfaction
to be assured that I have, in no part of them, lent my
assistance to foster <i>newly-hatched unfledged</i> opinions, or
endeavoured to support paradoxes, however tempting may
have been their novelty, or however ingenious I might,
for the minute, fancy them to be; nor shall I, I hope,
anywhere be found to have imposed on the minds of
young Students declamation for argument, a smooth period
for a sound precept. I have pursued a plain and <i>honest
method</i>: I have taken up the art simply as I found it
exemplified in the practice of the most approved Painters.
That approbation which the world has uniformly given, I
have endeavoured to justify by such proofs as questions of
this kind will admit; by the analogy which Painting holds
with the sister Arts, and, consequently, by the common
congeniality which they all bear to our nature. And
though in what has been done no new discovery is pretended,
I may still flatter myself, that from the discoveries
which others have made by their own intuitive good sense
and native rectitude of judgment, I have succeeded in
establishing the rules and principles of our art on a more
firm and lasting foundation than that on which they had
formerly been placed.</p>

<p>Without wishing to divert the Student from the practice
of his Art to speculative theory, to make him a mere
Connoisseur instead of a Painter, I cannot but remark,
that he will certainly find an account in considering, once
for all, on what ground the fabric of our art is built. Uncertain,
confused, or erroneous opinions are not only
detrimental to an Artist in their immediate operation, but
may possibly have very serious consequences; affect his conduct,
and give a peculiar character (as it may be called)
to his taste, and to his pursuits, through his whole life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
    I was acquainted at Rome, in the early part of my life,
with a Student of the French Academy, who appeared to
me to possess all the qualities requisite to make a great
Artist, if he had suffered his taste and feelings, and I may
add even his prejudices, to have fair play. He saw and felt
the excellencies of the great works of Art with which we
were surrounded, but lamented that there was not to be
found that Nature which is so admirable in the inferior
schools; and he supposed with Felibien, De Piles, and
other Theorists, that such an union of different excellencies
would be the perfection of Art. He was not aware that the
narrow idea of nature, of which he lamented the absence in
the works of those great Artists, would have destroyed the
grandeur of the general ideas which he admired, and which
was, indeed, the cause of his admiration. My opinions
being then confused and unsettled, I was in danger of
being borne down by this kind of plausible reasoning,
though I remember I then had a dawning of suspicion
that it was not sound doctrine; and at the same time I
was unwilling obstinately to refuse assent to what I was
unable to confute.</p>

<p>That the young Artist may not be seduced from the
right path by following what, at first view, he may think
the light of Reason, and which is indeed Reason in part,
but not in the whole, has been much the object of these
Discourses.</p>

<p>I have taken every opportunity of recommending a
rational method of study, as of the last importance. The
great, I may say the sole use of an Academy is, to put,
and for some time to keep, Students in that course, that
too much indulgence may not be given to peculiarity, and
that a young man may not be taught to believe, that what
is generally good for others is not good for him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
    I have strongly inculcated in my former Discourses, as I
do in this, my last, the wisdom and necessity of previously
obtaining the appropriated instruments of the Art, in a
first correct design, and a plain manly colouring before anything
more is attempted. But by this I would not wish to
cramp and fetter the mind, or discourage those who follow
(as most of us may at one time have followed) the suggestion
of a strong inclination: something must be conceded
to great and irresistible impulses: perhaps every Student
must not be strictly bound to general methods, if they
strongly thwart the peculiar turn of his own mind. I must
confess that it is not absolutely of much consequence
whether he proceeds in the general method of seeking first
to acquire mechanical accuracy, before he attempts poetical
flights, provided he diligently studies to attain the full
perfection of the style he pursues; whether, like
Parmegiano, he endeavours at grace and grandeur of
manner before he has learned correctness of drawing, if like
him he feels his own wants, and will labour, as that eminent
artist did, to supply those wants; whether he starts from
the East or from the West, if he relaxes in no exertion to
arrive ultimately at the same goal. The first public work
of Parmegiano is the St. Eustachius, in the church of St.
Petronius in Bologna, and was done when he was a boy;
and one of the last of his works is the Moses breaking the
tables in Parma. In the former there is certainly something
of grandeur in the outline, or in the conception of the
figure, which discovers the dawnings of future greatness;
of a young mind impregnated with the sublimity of Michel
Angelo, whose style he here attempts to imitate, though he
could not then draw the human figure with any common
degree of correctness. But this same Parmegiano, when
in his more mature age he painted the Moses, had so
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
completely supplied his first defects, that we are here at a loss
which to admire most, the correctness of drawing or the
grandeur of the conception. As a confirmation of its great
excellence, and of the impression which it leaves on the
minds of elegant spectators, I may observe, that our great
Lyric Poet, when he conceived his sublime idea of the
indignant Welsh Bard, acknowledged, that though many
years had intervened, he had warmed his imagination with
the remembrance of this noble figure of Parmegiano.</p>

<p>When we consider that Michel Angelo was the great
archetype to whom Parmegiano was indebted for that
grandeur which we find in his works, and from whom all
his contemporaries and successors have derived whatever
they have possessed of the dignified and the majestic; that
he was the bright luminary, from whom Painting has
borrowed a new lustre; that under his hands it assumed a
new appearance, and is become another and superior art; I
may be excused if I take this opportunity, as I have
hitherto taken every occasion, to turn your attention to this
exalted Founder and Father of Modern Art, of which he
was not only the inventor, but which, by the divine energy
of his own mind, he carried at once to its highest point
of possible perfection.</p>

<p>The sudden maturity to which Michel Angelo brought
our Art, and the comparative feebleness of his followers and
imitators, might perhaps be reasonably, at least plausibly
explained, if we had time for such an examination. At
present I shall only observe, that the subordinate parts of
our Art, and perhaps of other Arts, expand themselves by
a slow and progressive growth; but those which depend
on a native vigour of imagination generally burst forth at
once in fulness of beauty. Of this Homer probably,
and Shakespeare more assuredly, are singular examples.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
Michel Angelo possessed the poetical part of our art in a
most eminent degree; and the same daring spirit which
urged him first to explore the unknown regions of the
imagination, delighted with the novelty, and animated by
the success of his discoveries, could not have failed to
stimulate and impel him forward in his career beyond those
limits which his followers, destitute of the same incentives,
had not strength to pass.</p>

<p>To distinguish between correctness of drawing and that
part which respects the imagination, we may say the one
approaches to the mechanical (which in its way, too, may
make just pretensions to genius), and the other to the
poetical. To encourage a solid and vigorous course of
study, it may not be amiss to suggest, that perhaps a confidence
in the mechanic produces a boldness in the poetic.
He that is sure of the goodness of his ship and tackle puts
out fearlessly from the shore; and he who knows that his
hand can execute whatever his fancy can suggest, sports
with more freedom in embodying the visionary forms of his
own creation. I will not say Michel Angelo was eminently
poetical, only because he was greatly mechanical; but I am
sure that mechanic excellence invigorated and emboldened
his mind to carry painting into the regions of poetry, and
to emulate that art in its most adventurous flights.
Michel Angelo equally possessed both qualifications. Yet
of mechanic excellence there were certainly great examples
to be found in Ancient Sculpture, and particularly in the
fragment known by the name of the Torso of Michel
Angelo; but of that grandeur of character, air, and
attitude, which he threw into all his figures, and which so
well corresponds with the grandeur of his outline, there
was no example; it could therefore proceed only from the
most poetical and sublime imagination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
    It is impossible not to express some surprise that the
race of Painters who preceded Michel Angelo, men of
acknowledged great abilities, should never have thought of
transferring a little of that grandeur of outline which they
could not but see and admire in Ancient Sculpture, into
their own works; but they appear to have considered
Sculpture as the later Schools of Artists look at the inventions
of Michel Angelo&mdash;as something to be admired, but
with which they have nothing to do: <i>quod super nos, nihil
ad nos</i>.&mdash;The Artists of that age, even Raffaelle himself,
seemed to be going on very contentedly in the dry manner
of Pietro Perugino; and if Michel Angelo had never
appeared, the Art might still have continued in the same
style.</p>

<p>Beside Rome and Florence, where the grandeur of this
style was first displayed, it was on this Foundation that the
Caracci built the truly great Academical Bolognian school,
of which the first stone was laid by Pellegrino Tibaldi.
He first introduced this style amongst them; and many
instances might be given in which he appears to have possessed,
as by inheritance, the true, genuine, noble, and
elevated mind of Michel Angelo. Though we cannot
venture to speak of him with the same fondness as his
countrymen, and call him, as the Caracci did, <i>Nostro
Michel Angelo riformato</i>, yet he has a right to be considered
amongst the first and greatest of his followers;
there are certainly many drawings and inventions of his, of
which Michel Angelo himself might not disdain to be supposed
the author, or that they should be, as in fact they
often are, mistaken for his. I will mention one particular
instance, because it is found in a book which is in every
young Artist's hand;&mdash;Bishop's <i>Ancient Statues</i>. He
there has introduced a print, representing Polyphemus,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
from a drawing of Tibaldi, and has inscribed it with the
name of Michel Angelo, to whom he has also in the same
book attributed a Sybil of Raffaelle. Both these figures, it
is true, are professedly in Michel Angelo's style and spirit,
and even worthy of his hand. But we know that the
former is painted in the <i>Institute a Bologna</i> by Tibaldi, and
the other in the <i>Pace</i> by Raffaelle.</p>

<p>The Caracci, it is acknowledged, adopted the mechanical
part with sufficient success. But the divine part which
addresses itself to the imagination, as possessed by Michel
Angelo or Tibaldi, was beyond their grasp: they formed, however,
a most respectable school, a style more on the level, and
calculated to please a greater number; and if excellence of
this kind is to be valued according to the number rather
than the weight and quality of admirers, it would assume
even a higher rank in art. The same, in some sort, may be
said of Tintoret, Paolo Veronese, and others of the Venetian
Painters. They certainly much advanced the dignity of
their style by adding to their fascinating powers of colouring
something of the strength of Michel Angelo; at the same
time it may still be a doubt how far their ornamental
elegance would be an advantageous addition to his grandeur.
But if there is any manner of Painting which may be said
to unite kindly with his style, it is that of Titian. His
handling, the manner in which his colours are left on the
canvas, appears to proceed (as far as that goes) from a
congenial mind, equally disdainful of vulgar criticism.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Michel Angelo's</span> strength thus qualified, and made
more palatable to the general taste, reminds me of an
observation which I heard a learned critic make, when it
was incidentally remarked that our translation of Homer,
however excellent, did not convey the character, nor had
the grand air of the original. He replied, that if Pope
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
had not clothed the naked Majesty of Homer with the
graces and elegancies of modern fashions&mdash;though the real
dignity of Homer was degraded by such a dress, his
translation would not have met with such a favourable
reception, and he must have been contented with fewer
readers.</p>

<p>Many of the Flemish painters, who studied at Rome in
that great era of our art, such as Francis Rloris, Hemskirk,
Michael Coxis, Jerom Cock, and others, returned to their
own country with as much of this grandeur as they could
carry. But like seeds falling on a soil not prepared or
adapted to their nature, the manner of Michel Angelo
thrived but little with them; perhaps, however, they contributed
to prepare the way for that free, unconstrained,
and liberal outline, which was afterwards introduced by
Rubens through the medium of the Venetian Painters.</p>

<p>The grandeur of style has been in different degrees
disseminated over all Europe. Some caught it by living at
the time, and coming into contact with the original author,
whilst others received it at second hand; and being everywhere
adopted, it has totally changed the whole taste and
style of design, if there could be said to be any style before
his time. Our art, in consequence, now assumes a rank to
which it could never have dared to aspire, if Michel Angelo
had not discovered to the world the hidden powers which
it possessed. Without his assistance we never could have
been convinced that Painting was capable of producing an
adequate representation of the persons and actions of the
heroes of the Iliad.</p>

<p>I would ask any man qualified to judge of such works,
whether he can look with indifference at the personification
of the Supreme Being in the centre of the Capella Sestina,
or the figures of the Sybils which surround that chapel, to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
which we may add the statue of Moses; and whether the
same sensations are not excited by those works, as what he
may remember to have felt from the most sublime passages
of Homer? I mention those figures more particularly, as
they come nearer to a comparison with his Jupiter, his
demi-gods, and heroes; those Sybils and Prophets being a
kind of intermediate beings between men and angels.
Though instances may be produced in the works of other
Painters, which may justly stand in competition with those
I have mentioned&mdash;such as the Isaiah, and the vision of
Ezekiel, by Raffaelle, the St. Mark of Frate Bartolomeo,
and many others; yet these, it must be allowed, are inventions
so much in Michel Angelo's manner of thinking, that
they may be truly considered as so many rays, which
discover manifestly the centre from whence they emanated.</p>

<p>The sublime in Painting, as in Poetry, so overpowers,
and takes such a possession of the whole mind, that no
room is left for attention to minute criticism. The little
elegancies of art in the presence of these great ideas thus
greatly expressed, lose all their value, and are, for the
instant, at least, felt to be unworthy of our notice. The
correct judgment, the purity of taste which characterise
Raffaelle, the exquisite grace of Correggio and Parmegiano,
all disappear before them.</p>

<p>That Michel Angelo was capricious in his inventions
cannot be denied; and this may make some circumspection
necessary in studying his works; for though they appear
to become him, an imitation of them is always dangerous,
and will prove sometimes ridiculous. "Within that circle
none durst walk but he." To me, I confess his caprice
does not lower the estimation of his genius, even though it
is sometimes, I acknowledge, carried to the extreme: and
however those eccentric excursions are considered, we must
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
at the same time recollect that those faults, if they are
faults, are such as never could occur to a mean and vulgar
mind: that they flowed from the same source which produced
his greatest beauties, and were, therefore, such as
none but himself was capable of committing: they were
the powerful impulses of a mind unused to subjection of
any kind, and too high to be controlled by cold criticism.</p>

<p>Many see his daring extravagance who can see nothing
else. A young Artist finds the works of Michel Angelo so
totally different from those of his own master, or of those
with whom he is surrounded, that he may be easily persuaded
to abandon and neglect studying a style which
appears to him wild, mysterious, and above his comprehension,
and which he therefore feels no disposition to admire;
a good disposition, which he concludes that he should
naturally have, if the style deserved it. It is necessary,
therefore, that students should be prepared for the disappointment
which they may experience at their first setting
out; and they must be cautioned, that probably they will
not, at first sight, approve.</p>

<p>It must be remembered, that this great style itself is
artificial in the highest degree: it presupposes in the
spectator, a cultivated and prepared artificial state of mind.
It is an absurdity, therefore, to suppose that we are born
with this taste, though we are with the seeds of it, which,
by the heat and kindly influence of this genius, may be
ripened in us.</p>

<p>A late Philosopher and Critic<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> has observed, speaking of
taste, that <i>we are on no account to expect that fine things
should descend to us</i>&mdash;our taste, if possible, must be made
to ascend to them. The same learned writer recommends
to us <i>even to feign a relish, till we find a relish come</i>; <i>and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
feel, that what began in fiction, terminates in reality</i>. If
there be in our Art anything of that agreement or compact,
such as I apprehend there is in music, with which the
Critic is necessarily required previously to be acquainted,
in order to form a correct judgment: the comparison with
this art will illustrate what I have said on these points,
and tend to show the probability, we may say the certainty,
that men are not born with a relish for those arts in their
most refined state, which, as they cannot understand, they
cannot be impressed with their effects. This great style of
Michel Angelo is as far removed from the simple representation
of the common objects of nature, as the most
refined Italian music is from the inartificial notes of nature,
from whence they both profess to originate. But without
such a supposed compact, we may be very confident that
the highest state of refinement in either of those arts will
not be relished without a long and industrious attention.</p>

<p>In pursuing this great Art, it must be acknowledged
that we labour under greater difficulties than those who
were born in the age of its discovery, and whose minds
from their infancy were habituated to this style; who
learned it as language, as their mother tongue. They had
no mean taste to unlearn; they needed no persuasive
discourse to allure them to a favourable reception of it, no
abstruse investigation of its principles to convince them of
the great latent truths on which it is founded. We are
constrained, in these latter days, to have recourse to a sort
of Grammar and Dictionary, as the only means of recovering
a dead language. It was by them learned by rote, and
perhaps better learned that way than by precept.</p>

<p>The style of Michel Angelo, which I have compared to
language, and which may, poetically speaking, be called the
language of the Gods, now no longer exists, as it did in the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
fifteenth century; yet, with the aid of diligence, we may in
a great measure supply the deficiency which I mentioned&mdash;of
not having his works so perpetually before our eyes&mdash;by
having recourse to casts from his models and designs in
Sculpture; to drawings, or even copies of those drawings;
to prints, which, however ill executed, still convey something
by which this taste may be formed, and a relish may
be fixed and established in our minds for this grand style
of invention. Some examples of this kind we have in the
Academy, and I sincerely wish there were more, that the
younger students might in their first nourishment imbibe
this taste, whilst others, though settled in the practice of
the commonplace style of Painters, might infuse, by this
means, a grandeur into their works.</p>

<p>I shall now make some remarks on the course which I
think most proper to be pursued in such a study. I wish
you not to go so much to the derivative streams, as to the
fountain-head; though the copies are not to be neglected;
because they may give you hints in what manner you may
copy; and how the genius of one man may be made to fit
the peculiar manner of another.</p>

<p>To recover this lost taste, I would recommend young
Artists to study the works of Michel Angelo, as he himself
did the works of the ancient Sculptors; he began when a
child a copy of a mutilated Satyr's head, and finished in
his model what was wanting in the original. In the same
manner, the first exercise that I would recommend to the
young artist when he first attempts invention is, to select
every figure, if possible, from the inventions of Michel
Angelo. If such borrowed figures will not bend to his
purpose, and he is constrained to make a change to supply
a figure himself, that figure will necessarily be in the same
style with the rest; and his taste will by this means be
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
naturally initiated, and nursed in the lap of grandeur. He
will sooner perceive what constitutes this grand style by one
practical trial than by a thousand speculations, and he will
in some sort procure to himself the advantage which in
these later ages has been denied him&mdash;the advantage of
having the greatest of Artists for his master and instructor.</p>

<p>The next lesson should be, to change the purpose of the
figures without changing the attitude, as Tintoret has done
with the Samson of Michel Angelo. Instead of the figure
which Samson bestrides, he has placed an eagle under him:
and instead of the jaw-bone, thunder and lightning in his
right hand; and thus it becomes a Jupiter. Titian, in the
same manner, has taken the figure which represents God
dividing the light from the darkness in the vault of the
Capella Sestina, and has introduced it in the famous battle
of Cadore, so much celebrated by Vasari; and extraordinary
as it may seem, it is here converted to a general
falling from his horse. A real judge who should look at
this picture would immediately pronounce the attitude of
that figure to be in a greater style than any other figure of
the composition. These two instances may be sufficient,
though many more might be given in their works, as well
as in those of other great Artists.</p>

<p>When the Student has been habituated to this grand
conception of the Art, when the relish for this style is
established, makes a part of himself, and is woven into his
mind, he will, by this time, have got a power of selecting
from whatever occurs in nature that is grand, and corresponds
with that taste which he has now acquired, and
will pass over whatever is commonplace and insipid. He
may then bring to the mart such works of his own proper
invention as may enrich and increase the general stock of
invention in our Art.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
    I am confident of the truth and propriety of the advice
which I have recommended; at the same time I am aware
how much by this advice I have laid myself open to the
sarcasms of those critics who imagine our Art to be a
matter of inspiration. But I should be sorry it should
appear even to myself that I wanted that courage which I
have recommended to the Students in another way; equal
courage, perhaps, is required in the adviser and the advised;
they both must equally dare and bid defiance to narrow
criticism and vulgar opinion.</p>

<p>That the Art has been in a gradual state of decline, from
the age of Michel Angelo to the present, must be acknowledged;
and we may reasonably impute this declension to
the same cause to which the ancient Critics and Philosophers
have imputed the corruption of eloquence. Indeed,
the same causes are likely at all times and in all ages to
produce the same effects; indolence&mdash;not taking the same
pains as our great predecessors took&mdash;desiring to find a
shorter way&mdash;are the general imputed causes. The words
of Petronius<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> are very remarkable. After opposing the
natural chaste beauty of the eloquence of former ages to
the strained, inflated style then in fashion, "neither," says
he, "has the Art of Painting had a better fate, after the
boldness of the Egyptians had found out a compendious
way to execute so great an art."</p>

<p>By <i>compendious</i>, I understand him to mean a mode of
Painting such as has infected the style of the later Painters
of Italy and France; commonplace, without thought, and
with as little trouble, working as by a receipt; in contradistinction
to that style for which even a relish cannot
be acquired without care and long attention, and most
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
certainly the power of executing cannot be obtained without
the most laborious application.</p>

<p>I have endeavoured to stimulate the ambition of Artists
to tread in this great path of glory, and, as well as I can,
have pointed out the track which leads to it, and have at
the same time told them the price at which it may be
obtained. It is an ancient saying, that labour is the price
which the gods have set upon everything valuable.</p>

<p>The great Artist who has been so much the subject of the
present Discourse, was distinguished even from his infancy
for his indefatigable diligence; and this was continued
through his whole life, till prevented by extreme old age.
The poorest of men, as he observed himself, did not labour
from necessity more than he did from choice. Indeed,
from all the circumstances related of his life, he appears
not to have had the least conception that his art was to be
acquired by any other means than great labour; and yet
he, of all men that ever lived, might make the greatest
pretensions to the efficacy of native genius and inspiration.
I have no doubt that he would have thought it no disgrace
that it should be said of him, as he himself said of Raffaelle,
that he did not possess his art from nature, but by long
study.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a>
    <a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
    He was conscious that the great excellence to
which he arrived was gained by dint of labour, and was
unwilling to have it thought that any transcendent skill,
however natural its effects might seem, could be purchased
at a cheaper price than he had paid for it. This seems to
have been the true drift of his observation. We cannot
suppose it made with any intention of depreciating the
genius of Raffaelle, of whom he always spoke, as Coudivi
says, with the greatest respect: though they were rivals,
no such illiberality existed between them; and Raffaelle,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
on his part, entertained the greatest veneration for Michel
Angelo, as appears from the speech which is recorded of
him, that he congratulated himself, and thanked God, that
he was born in the same age with that painter.</p>

<p>If the high esteem and veneration in which Michel
Angelo has been held by all nations and in all ages should
be put to the account of prejudice, it must still be granted
that those prejudices could not have been entertained without
a cause: the ground of our prejudice, then, becomes the
source of our admiration. But from whatever it proceeds,
or whatever it is called, it will not, I hope, be thought presumptuous
in me to appear in the train, I cannot say of
his imitators, but of his admirers. I have taken another
course, one more suited to my abilities, and to the taste of
the times in which I live. Yet however unequal I feel
myself to that attempt, were I now to begin the world
again, I would tread in the steps of that great master: to
kiss the hem of his garment, to catch the slightest of his
perfections, would be glory and distinction enough for an
ambitious man.</p>

<p>I feel a self-congratulation in knowing myself capable of
such sensations as he intended to excite. I reflect, not
without vanity, that these Discourses bear testimony of
my admiration of that truly divine man; and I should
desire that the last words which I should pronounce in this
Academy, and from this place, might be the name of&mdash;<span class="smcap">Michel

<h3><span class="smcap">Number</span> 76.&#8195;&#8195;<i>Saturday, September 29, 1759.</i></h3>

<h2>TO THE IDLER.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>&mdash;I was much pleased with your ridicule of those
shallow Critics, whose judgment, though often right as far
as it goes, yet reaches only to inferior beauties; and who,
unable to comprehend the whole, judge only by parts, and
from thence determine the merit of extensive works. But
there is another kind of Critic still worse, who judges by
narrow rules, and those too often false, and which though
they should be true, and founded on nature, will lead him
but a very little way towards the just estimation of the
sublime beauties in works of Genius; for whatever part of
an art can be executed or criticised by rules, that part is
no longer the work of Genius, which implies excellence out
of the reach of rules. For my own part, I profess myself
an Idler, and love to give my judgment, such as it is, from
my immediate perceptions, without much fatigue of thinking;
and I am of opinion, that if a man has not those perceptions
right, it will be vain for him to endeavour to
supply their place by rules; which may enable him to talk
more learnedly, but not to distinguish more acutely.
Another reason which has lessened my affection for the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
study of Criticism is, that Critics, so far as I have observed,
debar themselves from receiving any pleasure from the
polite arts, at the same time that they profess to love and
admire them; for these rules being always uppermost, give
them such a propensity to criticise, that instead of giving
up the reins of their imagination into their author's hands,
their frigid minds are employed in examining whether the
performance be according to the rules of art.</p>

<p>To those who are resolved to be Critics in spite of nature,
and at the same time have no great disposition to much
reading and study, I would recommend to assume the
character of Connoisseur, which may be purchased at a
much cheaper rate than that of a Critic in poetry. The
remembrance of a few names of Painters, with their general
characters, and a few rules of the Academy, which they
may pick up among the Painters, will go a great way
towards making a very notable Connoisseur.</p>

<p>With a gentleman of this cast I visited last week the
Cartoons at Hampton Court; he was just returned from
Italy, a Connoisseur, of course, and of course his mouth full
of nothing but the Grace of Raffaelle, the Purity of
Domenichino, the Learning of Poussin, the Air of Guido,
the greatness of Taste of the Caraccis, and the Sublimity
and grand Contorno of Michel Angelo; with all the rest of
the cant of Criticism, which he emitted with that volubility
which generally those orators have, who annex no ideas to
their words.</p>

<p>As we were passing through the rooms, in our way to
the Gallery, I made him observe a whole length of Charles
the First, by Vandyke, as a perfect representation of the
character as well as the figure of the man. He agreed it
was very fine, but it wanted spirit and contrast, and had not
the flowing line, without which a figure could not possibly
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
be graceful. When we entered the Gallery, I thought
I could perceive him recollecting his Rules by which he was
to criticise Raffaelle. I shall pass over his observation of
the boats being too little, and other criticisms of that kind,
till we arrived at St. <i>Paul preaching</i>. "This," says he, "is
esteemed the most excellent of all the Cartoons: what
nobleness, what dignity there is in that figure of St. Paul!
and yet what an addition to that nobleness could Raffaelle
have given, had the art of Contrast been known in his
time; but above all, the flowing line, which constitutes
Grace and Beauty! You would not then have seen an upright
figure standing equally on both legs, and both hands
stretched forward in the same direction, and his drapery,
to all appearance, without the least art of disposition."
The following Picture is the <i>Charge to Peter</i>. "Here,"
says he, "are twelve upright figures; what a pity it is that
Raffaelle was not acquainted with the pyramidal principle!
he would then have contrived the figures in the middle to
have been on higher ground, or the figures at the extremities
stooping or lying; which would not only have formed the
group into the shape of a pyramid, but likewise contrasted
the standing figures. Indeed," added he, "I have often
lamented that so great a genius as Raffaelle had not lived
in this enlightened age, since the art has been reduced to
principles, and had his education in one of the modern
Academies; what glorious works might we then have
expected from his divine pencil!"</p>

<p>I shall trouble you no longer with my friend's observations,
which, I suppose, you are now able to continue by
yourself. It is curious to observe, that at the same time
that great admiration is pretended for a name of fixed
reputation, objections are raised against those very qualities
by which that great name was acquired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
    These Critics are continually lamenting that Raffaelle
had not the Colouring and Harmony of Rubens, or the
Light and Shadow of Rembrandt, without considering how
much the gay harmony of the former, and affectation of the
latter, would take from the Dignity of Raffaelle; and yet
Rubens had great Harmony, and Rembrandt understood
Light and Shadow; but what may be an excellence in
a lower class of Painting, becomes a blemish in a higher;
as the quick, sprightly turn, which is the life and beauty of
epigrammatic compositions, would but ill suit with the
majesty of heroic Poetry.</p>

<p>To conclude; I would not be thought to infer from
anything that has been said, that Rules are absolutely
unnecessary, but to censure scrupulosity, a servile attention
to minute exactness, which is sometimes inconsistent with
higher excellence, and is lost in the blaze of expanded
genius.</p>

<p>I do not know whether you will think Painting a general
subject. By inserting this letter, perhaps you will incur
the censure a man would deserve, whose business being to
entertain a whole room, should turn his back on a company,
and talk to a particular person.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Number</span> 79.&#8195;&#8195;<i>Saturday, October 20, 1759.</i></h3>
<h2>TO THE IDLER.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>&mdash;Your acceptance of a former letter on Painting
gives me encouragement to offer a few more sketches on the
same subject.</p>

<p>Amongst the Painters and the writers on Painting there
is one maxim universally admitted and continually inculcated.
<i>Imitate Nature</i> is the invariable rule; but I know
none who have explained in what manner this rule is to be
understood; the consequence of which is, that every one
takes it in the most obvious sense&mdash;that objects are
represented naturally, when they have such relief that they
seem real. It may appear strange, perhaps, to hear this
sense of the rule disputed; but it must be considered, that
if the excellency of a Painter consisted only in this kind of
imitation, Painting must lose its rank, and be no longer
considered as a liberal art, and sister to Poetry: this
imitation being merely mechanical, in which the slowest
intellect is always sure to succeed best; for the Painter of
genius cannot stoop to drudgery, in which the understanding
has no part; and what pretence has the Art to claim
kindred with Poetry, but by its power over the imagination?
To this power the Painter of genius directs his aim; in this
sense he studies Nature, and often arrives at his end, even
by being unnatural, in the confined sense of the word.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
    The grand style of Painting requires this minute attention
to be carefully avoided, and must be kept as separate from
it as the style of Poetry from that of History. Poetical
ornaments destroy that air of truth and plainness which
ought to characterise History; but the very being of
Poetry consists in departing from this plain narration, and
adopting every ornament that will warm the imagination.
To desire to see the excellencies of each style united, to
mingle the Dutch with the Italian School, is to join contrarieties
which cannot subsist together, and which destroy
the efficacy of each other. The Italian attends only to the
invariable, the great and general ideas which are fixed and
inherent in universal Nature; the Dutch, on the contrary,
to literal truth and a minute exactness in the detail, as I
may say, of Nature, modified by accident. The attention
to these petty peculiarities is the very cause of this
naturalness so much admired in the Dutch pictures, which,
if we suppose it to be a beauty is certainly of a lower
order, that ought to give place to a beauty of a superior
kind, since one cannot be obtained but by departing from
the other.</p>

<p>If my opinion were asked concerning the works of
Michel Angelo, whether they would receive any advantage
from possessing this mechanical merit, I should not scruple
to say they would lose, in a great measure, the effect which
they now have on every mind susceptible of great and noble
ideas. His works may be said to be all genius and soul;
and why should they be loaded with heavy matter, which
can only counteract his purpose by retarding the progress
of the imagination?</p>

<p>If this opinion should be thought one of the wild
extravagancies of enthusiasm, I shall only say, that those
who censure it are not conversant in the works of the great
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
Masters. It is very difficult to determine the exact degree
of enthusiasm that the arts of Painting and Poetry may
admit. There may perhaps be too great an indulgence, as
well as too great a restraint of imagination; and if the one
produces incoherent monsters, the other produces what is
full as bad, lifeless insipidity. An intimate knowledge of
the passions and good sense, but not common sense, must at
last determine its limits. It has been thought, and I
believe with reason, that Michel Angelo sometimes transgressed
those limits; and I think I have seen figures by
him, of which it was very difficult to determine whether
they were in the highest degree sublime or extremely
ridiculous. Such faults may be said to be the ebullition of
genius; but at least he had this merit, that he never was
insipid; and whatever passion his works may excite, they
will always escape contempt.</p>

<p>What I have had under consideration is the sublimest
style, particularly that of Michel Angelo, the Homer of
Painting. Other kinds may admit of this naturalness,
which of the lowest kind is the chief merit; but in
Painting, as in Poetry, the highest style has the least of
common nature.</p>

<p>One may safely recommend a little more enthusiasm to
the modern Painters; too much is certainly not the vice of
the present age. The Italians seem to have been continually
declining in this respect from the time of Michel
Angelo to that of Carlo Maratti, and from thence to the
very bathos of insipidity to which they are now sunk; so
that there is no need of remarking, that where I mentioned
the Italian Painters in opposition to the Dutch, I mean not
the moderns, but the heads of the old Roman and Bolognian
Schools; nor did I mean to include in my idea of an Italian
Painter, the Venetian School, which may be said to be the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
Dutch part of the Italian Genius. I have only to add a
word of advice to the Painters&mdash;that however excellent
they may be in painting naturally, they would not flatter
themselves very much upon it; and to the Connoisseurs,
that when they see a cat or a fiddle painted so finely, that,
as the phrase is, <i>it looks as if you could take it up</i>, they
would not for that reason immediately compare the Painter
to Raffaelle and Michel Angelo.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Number</span> 82.&#8195;&#8195;<i>Saturday, November 10, 1759.</i></h3>
<h2>TO THE IDLER.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>&mdash;Discoursing in my last letter on the different practice
of the Italian and Dutch Painters, I observed that
"the Italian Painter attends only to the invariable, the
great, and general ideas, which are fixed and inherent in
universal nature."</p>

<p>I was led into the subject of this letter by endeavouring
to fix the original cause of this conduct of the Italian
Masters. If it can be proved that by this choice they
selected the most beautiful part of the creation, it will
show how much their principles are founded on reason, and,
at the same time, discover the origin of our ideas of beauty.</p>

<p>I suppose it will be easily granted that no man can judge
whether any animal be beautiful in its kind, or deformed,
who has seen only one of that species; this is as conclusive
in regard to the human figure; so that if a man, born
blind, were to recover his sight, and the most beautiful
woman were brought before him, he could not determine
whether she was handsome or not; nor if the most beautiful
and most deformed were produced, could he any better
determine to which he should give the preference, having
seen only those two. To distinguish beauty, then, implies
the having seen many individuals of that species. If it is
asked, how is more skill acquired by the observation of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
greater numbers? I answer, that, in consequence of having
seen many, the power is acquired, even without seeking
after it, of distinguishing between accidental blemishes and
excrescences which are continually varying the surface of
Nature's works, and the invariable general form which
Nature most frequently produces, and always seems to
intend in her productions.</p>

<p>Thus amongst the blades of grass or leaves of the same
tree, though no two can be found exactly alike, the general
form is invariable: a Naturalist, before he chose one as a
sample, would examine many; since if he took the first
that occurred, it might have by accident or otherwise such
a form as that it would scarce be known to belong to that
species; he selects as the Painter does, the most beautiful,
that is, the most general form of nature.</p>

<p>Every species of the animal as well as the vegetable
creation may be said to have a fixed or determinate form,
towards which Nature is continually inclining, like various
lines terminating in the centre; or it may be compared to
pendulums vibrating in different directions over one central
point: and as they all cross the centre, though only one
passes through any other point, so it will be found that
perfect beauty is oftener produced by Nature than deformity:
I do not mean than deformity in general, but than
any one kind of deformity. To instance in a particular
part of a feature; the line that forms a ridge of the nose is
beautiful when it is straight; this, then, is the central form,
which is oftener found than either concave, convex, or any
other irregular form that shall be proposed. As we are
then more accustomed to beauty than deformity, we may
conclude that to be the reason why we approve and admire
it, as we approve and admire customs and fashions of dress
for no other reason than that we are used to them; so that
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
though habit and custom cannot be said to be the cause of
beauty, it is certainly the cause of our liking it; and I
have no doubt but that if we were more used to deformity
than beauty, deformity would then lose the idea now
annexed to it, and take that of beauty: as if the whole
world should agree, that <i>yes</i> and <i>no</i> should change their
meaning; <i>yes</i> would then deny, and <i>no</i> would affirm.</p>

<p>Whoever undertakes to proceed further in this argument,
and endeavours to fix a general criterion of beauty
respecting different species, or to show why one species is
more beautiful than another, it will be required from him
first to prove that one species is really more beautiful than
another. That we prefer one to the other, and with very
good reason, will be readily granted; but it does not follow
from thence that we think it a more beautiful form; for
we have no criterion of form by which to determine our
judgment. He who says a swan is more beautiful than a
dove, means little more than that he has more pleasure in
seeing a swan than a dove, either from the stateliness of its
motions, or its being a more rare bird; and he who gives
the preference to the dove, does it from some association
of ideas of innocence which he always annexes to the
dove; but if he pretends to defend the preference he gives
to one or the other by endeavouring to prove that this more
beautiful form proceeds from a particular gradation of
magnitude, undulation of a curve, or direction of a line, or
whatever other conceit of his imagination he shall fix on, as
a criterion of form, he will be continually contradicting
himself, and find at last that the great Mother of Nature
will not be subjected to such narrow rules. Among the
various reasons why we prefer one part of her works to
another, the most general, I believe, is habit and custom;
custom makes, in a certain sense, white black, and black
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
white; it is custom alone determines our preference of the
colour of the Europeans to the Ethiopians, and they, for
the same reason, prefer their own colour to ours. I suppose
nobody will doubt, if one of their Painters were to paint
the Goddess of Beauty, but that he would represent her
black, with thick lips, flat nose, and woolly hair; and, it
seems to me, he would act very unnaturally if he did not,
for by what criterion will anyone dispute the propriety of
his idea? We indeed say that the form and colour of the
European is preferable to that of the Ethiopian; but I
know of no other reason we have for it, but that we are
more accustomed to it. It is absurd to say that beauty is
possessed of attractive powers, which irresistibly seize the
corresponding mind with love and admiration, since that
argument is equally conclusive in favour of the white and
the black philosophers.</p>

<p>The black and white nations must, in respect of beauty,
be considered as of different kinds, at least a different
species of the same kind; from one of which to the other,
as I observed, no inference can be drawn.</p>

<p>Novelty is said to be one of the causes of beauty. That
novelty is a very sufficient reason why we should admire is
not denied; but because it is uncommon, is it therefore
beautiful? The beauty that is produced by colour, as
when we prefer one bird to another, though of the same
form, on account of its colour, has nothing to do with the
argument, which reaches only to form. I have here considered
the word Beauty as being properly applied to form
alone. There is a necessity of fixing this confined sense;
for there can be no argument, if the sense of the word is
extended to everything that is approved. A rose may as
well be said to be beautiful because it has a fine smell, as
a bird because of its colour. When we apply the word
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
Beauty, we do not mean always by it a more beautiful form,
but something valuable on account of its rarity, usefulness,
colour, or any other property. A horse is said to be a
beautiful animal; but had a horse as few good qualities
as a tortoise, I do not imagine that he would then be
deemed beautiful.</p>

<p>A fitness to the end proposed is said to be another cause
of beauty; but supposing we were proper judges of what
form is the most proper in an animal to constitute strength
or swiftness, we always determine concerning its beauty,
before we exert our understanding to judge of its fitness.</p>

<p>From what has been said, it may be inferred, that the
works of Nature, if we compare one species with another,
are all equally beautiful, and that preference is given from
custom or some association of ideas; and that, in creatures
of the same species, beauty is the medium or centre of all
its various forms.</p>

<p>To conclude, then, by way of corollary: if it has been
proved that the Painter, by attending to the invariable and
general ideas of Nature, produce beauty, he must, by
regarding minute particularities, and accidental discriminations,
deviate from the universal rule, and pollute his
canvas with deformity.</p>
